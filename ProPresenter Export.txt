Title: 10,000 REASONS

Bless the Lord O my soul
O my soul, worship His Holy name

Sing like never before, O my soul
I’ll worship Your Holy name

The sun comes up
It’s a new day dawning

It’s time to sing Your song again

Whatever may pass
And whatever lies before me

Let me be singing
When the evening comes

You’re rich in love
And You’re slow to anger

Your name is great
And Your heart is kind

For all Your goodness
I will keep on singing

Ten thousand reasons
For my heart to find

And on that day 
When my strength is failing

The end draws near
And my time has come

Still my soul will
Sing Your praise unending

Ten thousand years
And then forevermore
