Title: 你的救恩

黑夜笼罩　似乎不見光
When the darkness covers the light

阴间绳索　缠扰着我们
When the snares of death entangle and encircle

求祢睁眼看 侧耳听祷告
Will You look upon us and turn Your ear to us

祢百姓　在这里祈求
Your people cry out to You now

祢的信实  是我们盼望
Your faithfulness is our hope

祢的应许  黑暗中曙光
Your promise a beacon in the dark.

祢必睁眼看  侧耳听祷告
Will You look upon us and turn Your ear to us

这百姓是祢所爱的
We are Your people whom You love

急难之中 我们回转向祢
In our distress we turn back to You.

祢是主 承认祢是主
You are Lord, we declare you as Lord

求祢转意 不发祢的烈怒
Would You relent and turn from Your wrath

祢是主 祢是救我们的主
 You are Lord, You’re the Lord of our salvation 

求祢医治 求祢怜悯
Come heal this land, pour out Your mercy 

求祢兴起 仇敌就退去
As You arise Your enemies shall flee

我们呼求 阿爸天父
We cry out, Abba Father

 祢的救恩 必降临这地
Your salvation will come upon this land

Title: Open Up The Sky

Father, loving Father
 Please come down and lead us

We are waiting on Your touch

Open up the heavens
 Shower down Your presence 

We respond to Your great love

 Open up the sky
 Fall down like rain 

We don't want blessings
 We want You

Open up the sky, fall down like fire
 We don't want anything but You


Father, loving Father
 We just want to see You 

With the glory of Your light

 Earthly things don't matter
 They just break and shatter

 Rain a touch from love divine

 Here we go
 Let's go to Your throne

 The place where we belong
 Right into His arms

Title: Strength Of My Life (2L)

You set my heart ablaze 
With Your Holy fire 

And now I stand amazed by 
Your love and favour 

I don't know where I will be 
I don't know what I would do now 

If Your love hadn't saved me 

You are the strength of my life 
And I'm eternally grateful 

Great are You Lord over all 
We will declare Lord You are faithful 

Great are You Lord over all 
Great are You Lord 

You are the strength of my life, Lord
It doesn't matter what may come my way

You are the strength of my life Lord 
I'm holding on to You

Title: The Anthem (2L)

By His stripes we are healed
By His nail-pierced hands we're free

By His blood we're washed clean
Now we have the victory

The power of sin is broken
Jesus overcame it all

He has won our freedom
Jesus has won it all 

Hallelujah, You have won the victory
Hallelujah, You have won it all for me

Death could not hold You down 
You are the risen King 

Seated in majesty 
You are the risen King

Our God is risen, He is alive
He won the victory, He reigns on high
