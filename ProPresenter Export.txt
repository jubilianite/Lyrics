Come and worship, come and worship

Worship Christ, the newborn King.

Shepherds, in the field abiding,

Watching o'er your flocks by night,

God with us is now residing;

Yonder shines the infant light:

Sages, leave your contemplations,

Brighter visions beam afar;

Seek the great Desire of nations;

Ye have seen His natal star.

Saints, before the altar bending,

Watching long in hope and fear;

Suddenly the Lord, descending,

In His temple shall appear.

Sinners, wrung with true repentance,

Doomed for guilt to endless pains,

Justice now revokes the sentence,

Mercy calls you, break your chains.

Though an infant now we view Him,

He shall fill His Father's throne,

Gather all nations to Him;

Every knee shall then bow down:

All creation, join in praising

God, the Father, Spirit, Son,

Sweetly singing o'ver the plains

Title: As You Find Me 

I've been strong
And I've been broken within a moment

I've been faithful
And I've been reckless at every bend

I've held everything together
And watched it shatter

I've stood tall and I have crumbled
In the same breath

I have wrestled
And I have trembled toward surrender

Chased my heart adrift
And drifted home again

Plundered blessing
Till I've been desperate to find redemption

And every time I turn around
Lord You're still there

I have wrestled and I have 
trembled toward surrender 

Chased my heart adrift and 
drifted home again

 Plundered blessing   
Till I’ve been desperate to find redemption

 And every time I turn around 
 Lord You’re still there

I was found
before I was lost

 I was Yours before I was not  
 Grace to spare

For all my mistakes
 And that part just wrecks me

And I know I don’t deserve this kind of love  
Somehow this kind of love is who You are

 It’s a grace I could never add up
 To be somebody You still want

 But somehow You 
love me as You find me

Who am I 
to think Your glory needs my praises

 But if this borrowed breath is Yours Lord
take it all

 You are faithful and You are gracious 
 And I’m just grateful

 To think You don’t need a single thing
And still You want my heart

You love me as You find me 
 Your love’s too good to leave me here

If You want my heart
I won’t second guess

 ‘Cause I need Your love
More than anything

 I’m in, I’m Yours 
 Your love’s too good to leave me here

 Your love’s too good to leave me

If You want my heart
I won’t second guess

‘Cause I need Your love
More than anything

I’m in, I’m Yours
 Your love’s too good to leave me here

Your love’s too good to leave me

You have overcome the grave
Your glory fills the highest place
What can separate me now


You go before me
You shield my way
Your hand upholds me
I know You love me
I know You love me



And when the earth fades
Falls from my eyes
And You stand before me
I know You love me
I know You love me



You tore the veil
You made a way
When You said that it is done

 Comes flowing down

Title: At The Cross (Where I First Saw The Light) 2L

Alas, and did my Saviour bleed
And did my Sovereign die

Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I

At the Cross, at the Cross
Where I first saw the light

And the burden of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith I received my sight

And now I am happy all the day

Was it for crimes that I have done
He groaned upon that tree

Amazing pity! Grace unknown
And I love beyond degree

Well might the sun in darkness hide
And shut His glories in

When Christ, the mighty maker, died
For man the creature's sin

But drops of grief can never repay
The debt of love I owe

Here, Lord I give myself away
'Tis all that I can do

Saw God's plan for fallen man
Now I live for Him alone
For my sins did He atone
When I knelt at the foot of the Cross

From morning sun to night 

But the seas between us broad have roared 
From auld lang syne

Away in a manger
 No crib for His bed
 The little Lord Jesus
 Laid down His sweet head
 



 The stars in the sky
 Looked down where He lay
 The little Lord Jesus
 Asleep on the hay
 



 The cattle are lowing
 The Baby awakes
 But little Lord Jesus
 No crying He makes



 I love Thee, Lord Jesus
 Look down from the sky
 And stay by my cradle
 Till morning is nigh



 Be near me, Lord Jesus
 I ask Thee to stay
 Close by me forever
 And love me, I pray



 Bless all the dear children
 In Thy tender care
 And fit us for heaven
 To live with Thee there

Title: Awesome In This Place (Here In This House 2L)

Here in this house of the great King
We've come together now to worship Him

This house is built on Christ, our Rock
Cannot be shaken, cannot be shaken

God is awesome in this place
We sense His presence as we sing His praise

There is power here for miracles
To set the captives free and make the broken whole

God is awesome, He's so awesome
God is awesome in this place

I've found where I belong, I’m a living stone
And in this house I will grow

Title: BABAD

Kaysarap-sarap pa rin sa’yo, Panginoon
 (It’s still so delightful 
 to be in Your presence, Lord)
 Ang mga pagpapala mo’ay lubos-lubos
 (Your blessings overflow)


Minsan ang ating ka away
 (Sometimes our enemy)
 Pilit na tinatangay ang dadamin
 (Tries to steal our hearts)



At sa ating pagpupuri
 (And in our praises)
 Ako’y lubos na nagtagumpay
 (I am truly victorious)
 



Ang kailangan lang ay
 (I just need to be)
 Babad sa presensya mo
 (Soaked in Your presence)


 Babad sa iyong salita
 (Soaked in Your Word)
 Babad ang sekreto ko
 (Soaking is my secret)
 Kung bakit ako’y masaya
 (Why I am so happy)



Ang kailangan lang ay
 (I just need to be)
 Babad sa presensya mo
 (Soaked in Your presence)



Babad sa iyong salita
 (Soaked in Your Word)
 Tulad ng isang usa
 (Just like the deer)
 Na laging uhan sa’yo
 (Always thirsty for You)

Hi Good morning everybody, Its a great thing to be in Gods's presence

Title: BATTLE BELONGS

When all I see is the battle
You see my victory

When all I see is the mountain 
You see a mountain moved

And as I walk through the shadow
Your love surrounds me

There's nothing to fear now
For I am safe with You

So when I fight
I'll fight on my knees

With my hands lifted high

Oh God, the battle belongs to You
And every fear I lay at Your feet

I'll sing through the night
Oh God, the battle belongs to You

And if You are for me
Who can be against me?

For Jesus 
There's nothing impossible for You

When all I see are the ashes
You see the beauty

When all I see is a cross, God
You see the empty tomb

Almighty fortress
You go before us

Nothing can stand against 
The power of our God

You shine in the shadow
You win every battle

Nothing can stand against 
The power of our God

Title: Battle Hymn Of Republic

Mine eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord

He is trampling out the vintage
Where the grapes of wealth are stored

He has loosed the fateful lightning
Of His terrible swift sword

His truth is marching on

Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!

Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
His truth is marching on

In the beauty of the lilies
Christ was born across the sea

With the glory in His bosom
That transfigures you and me

As He died to make men free
Let us live to make men free

His truth is marching on

I can almost hear the trumpet sound
The Lord's return is near

But there are still so many people lost
Somehow they've got to hear

Lord, please give me one more hour
One more day

Just one more year
With Your truth we're marching on

Title: Battle Hymn of the Republic

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;

He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;

He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;

His truth is marching on.

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watch fires of a hundred circling camps

They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;

I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps;

His day is marching on.

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His day is marching on.

I have read a fiery Gospel writ in burnished rows of steel;

"As ye deal with My contemners, so with you My grace shall deal";

Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with His heel,

Since God is marching on.

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Since God is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;

He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;

Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet;

Our God is marching on.

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,

With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;

As He died to make men holy, let us live to make men free;

While God is marching on.

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! While God is marching on.

He is coming like the glory of the morning on the wave,

He is wisdom to the mighty, He is honor to the brave;

So the world shall be His footstool, and the soul of wrong His slave,

Our God is marching on.

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Our God is marching on.

And joy he gives

But greater still the calm assurance

This child can face uncertain days 
Because He lives

And then one day
I'll cross the river

I'll fight life's final war with pain

And then, as death gives way to victory,

I'll see the lights of glory 
And I'll know He Lives

生命充满了希望只因他活着

How sweet to hold a newborn baby
何等甘甜靠耶稣基督

And feel the pride and joy he gives
祂带给我满足喜乐

But greater still the calm assurance
更觉安慰乃是我确信

This child can face uncertain days because He lives
我能面对未来坎坷因主活着

And then one day, I'll cross the river
我有一天会渡生命河

I'll fight life's final war with pain
人生苦难一一攻克

And then, as death gives way to victory,
我深知道祂掌管明天

I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He Lives
 生命充满了希望只因祂活着

Title: Before the Throne of God Above

Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea


A great High Priest
Whose name is Love
Who ever lives and pleads for me


My name is graven on His hands
My name is written on His heart


I know that while in heaven He stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart


When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within


Upward I look
And see Him there
Who made an end to all my sin


Because the sinless Savior died
My sinful soul is counted free


For God the just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardme
To look on Him and pardme


Behold Him there
The Risen Lamb
My perfect, spotless righteousness


The great unchangeable I am
The King of glory and of grace


One with Himself I cannot die
My soul is purchased by His blood


My life is hid with Christ on high
With Christ, my Savior and my God
With Christ, my Savior and my God


Title: Begin In Me

Holy Spirit, I adore You
Holy One, have Your way
Before You, now
My heart's wide open
Take Your rightful place


Let Your work begin in me
With Your power set me free
Reign in all the kingdoms of my heart


I have one sole desire
You will come and fill my life
Till the world can see
Jesus Christ in me

Title: Believe

I say on Sunday
How much I want revival
But then, on Monday
I can't even find my Bible


Where's the power
The power of the cross in my life


I'm sick of playing
The game of religion
I'm tired of losing
My reason for living


Where's the power
The power of the cross in my life


I'm not content just
To walk through my life
Giving in to the lies
Walking in compromises now


We cry out as a generation
That was lost
But now is found in
The power of the cross


We believe in You
We believe in the power
Of Your word and its truth


We believe in You
So we lay down our cause
That our cross might be found in You


I'm not satisfied
Doing it my own way
I'm not satisfied
To do church and walk away
I'm not satisfied
There's no love in my life but You


I'm not satisfied
Living in yesterday's hour
I'm not satisfied
To have the form but not the power
I'm not satisfied
O Lord, I am crucified in You


Title: Beloved Let Us Love One Another

Beloved let us love one another
For love is from God
And everyone who loves
Is born of God
And he knows God


The one who does not love
Does not know God
For God is love
Beloved let us love one another
For love is from God


Title: BENEATH THE WATERS (I WILL RISE) 

This is my revelation 
 Christ Jesus crucified 
 Salvation through repentance 
 At the cross on which He died 




Now here  my absolution 
 Forgiveness for my sin 
 And I sink beneath the waters 
 That Christ was buried in 



I will rise, I will rise 
 As Christ was raised to life 
 Now in Him, Now in Him 
 I live 



I stand a new creation 
 Baptised in blood and fire 
 No fear of condemnation 
 By faith I'm justified 



I rise as You are risen 
 Declare Your rule and reign
 My life confess Your Lordship 
 And glorify your name 




Your word it stands eternal 
 Your kingdom knows no end 
 Your praise goes on forever 
 And on and on again 


 No power can stand against You 
 No curse assault Your throne
 No one can steal Your glory 
 For it is Yours alone 



I stand to sing Your praises 
 I stand to testify 
 For I was dead in my sin



But now I rise, I will rise 
 As Christ was raised to life 
 Now in Him, Now in Him 
 I live

Better than living the life that I want to
Better than the love anyone could give

In Your arms and never let me go

Make the sunshine

In the night sky

And all Your love
I give my heart to You because


I can't stop falling in love with You
I'll never stop falling in love with You

Somewhere in outer space
God has prepared a place
For those who trust Him and obey


Jesus will come again
And though we don't know when
The countdown's getting lower everyday


10 and 9 
8 and 7 
6 and 5 and 4,
Call upon the Savior while you may


3 and 2
Coming through the clouds in bright array
The countdown's getting lower everyday


Jesus was crucified
Suffered and bled, He died
But on the cross
He did not stay


He made this promise true
I will come back for You
The countdown's getting lower everyday


Soon will the trumpet sound
And we'll rise off the ground
With Christ
Forever we will be


Children where will you be
Throughout eternity?
The countdown's getting lower everyday!

Title: Blessed assurance

Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!

O what a foretaste of glory divine!

Heir of salvation, purchase of God,

Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.

This is my story, this is my song,

Praising my Savior, all the day long;

This is my story, this is my song,

Praising my Savior, all the day long.

Perfect submission, perfect delight,

Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;

Angels descending bring from above

Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

Perfect submission, all is at rest

I in my Savior am happy and blest,

Watching and waiting, looking above,

Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.

All these pieces
Broken and scattered
In mercy gathered
Mended and whole



Empty handed
But not forsaken
I've been set free
I've been set free



Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me



I once was lost
But now I'm found
Was blind but now I see



Oh I can see You now
Oh I can see the love in Your eyes
Laying Yourself down
Raising up the broken to life



You take our failure
You take our weakness
You set Your treasure
In jars of clay



So take this heart Lord
I'll be Your vessel
The world to see
Your life in me

Pushing back every force of hell
Casting down the imaginations

See Him lying on a bed of straw
 A draughty stable with an open door
 Mary cradling the babe she bore
 The prince of glory is His name

 O now carry me to Bethlehem
 To see the Lord appear to men
 Just as poor as was the stable then
 The Prince of Glory when He came

 Show where Jesus in the manger lies
 Shepherds swiftly from your stupor rise
 To see the Saviour of the world

 Bring God's glory to the heart of man
 Sing that Bethlehem's little baby can
 Be salvation to the soul

 And never fill the longings of my heart

And never know the thrill of what could be
 With every star so far and out of reach
 I could live without many things
 And I could carry on, but
 




I couldn't face my life tomorrow
 Without Your hope in my heart I know
 I can't live a day without You
 Lord, there's no night 
 And there's no morning



Without Your loving arms to hold me
 You're the heartbeat of all I do
 I can't live a day without You
 



I could travel the world
 See all the wonders beautiful and new
 They'd only make me think of You
 And I could have all life offers



Riches that were far beyond compare
 To grant my every wish without a care
 Oh, I could do anything, oh yes
 But if You weren't in it all




Jesus, I live because You live
 You're like the air I breathe
 Oh Jesus, oh, I have because You give
 You're everything to me
 



Title: Can't Stop Praising

Try to find the words
 To express the way You are
 But the beauty of the Lord
 Cannot be described in just one lifetime



Look at the sun over the seas
 Look at Your grace that covers me
 Now I know
 Yes, I know
 Now I know
 I know Your love has saved me
 




CHORUS:
 In the morning
 I can't stop praising Your name
 In the evening
 I can't stop praising Your name
 




And I want you to know
 Yes, I want you to know
 Oh yes, I




Lord, You're so amazing
 Every word You say is true
 Better than the finest treasure
 So glad that I found You
 




You held me close
 When I was down
 Your world has turned my world around
 




Now I know
 Yes I know
 Now I know
 I know how much I love You
 




Hallelujah
 We praise Your name
 We praise Your name

Title: Carried To The Table

 Wounded and forsaken 
 I was shattered by the fall 
 Broken and forgotten 
 Feeling lost and all alone 
 



Summoned by the King 
 Into the Master’s courts 
 Lifted by the Saviour 
 And cradled in His arms 




 CHORUS:
 I was carried to the table 
 Seated where I don’t belong 
 Carried to the table 
 Swept away by His love 




  And I don’t see my brokenness anymore 
 When I’m seated at the table of the Lord 
 I’m carried to the table 
 The table of the Lord 

 



 Fighting thoughts of fear 
 And wondering why He called my name 
 Am I good enough to share this cup 
 This world has left me lame 

 



Even in my weakness 
 The Saviour called my name 
 In His Holy presence 
 I’m healed and unashamed 

 



 You carried me, my God 
 You carried me
 



Title: Carry Me

 You lead me into Your courts
 Surround me with Your love
 I walk with You
 I do not fear



  In this place
 Dreams are met
 In this place
 Where You are




CHORUS:
 Carry me here
 In Your arms of love
 Draw me close to You
 I want to be where You are
 



 You carry me
 You are my strength
 I learn to trust in You
 And once again I am reaching out

Title: Champion - Bethel

I’ve tried so hard to see it
Took me so long to believe it

That You’d choose someone like me
To carry Your victory

Perfection could never earn it
You give what we don’t deserve and

You take the broken things
And raise them to glory

You are my champion
Giants fall when you stand

Undefeated
Every battle You’ve won

I am who You say I am
You crown me with confidence

I am seated, in the heavenly place
Undefeated, with the

One who has conquered it all

Now I can finally see it
You’re teaching me how to receive

So let all the striving cease
This is my victory

When I lift my voice and shout
Every wall comes crashing down

I have the authority
Jesus has given me

When I open up my mouth
Miracles start breaking out

I have the authority
Jesus has given me

You are my champion
Giants fall when you stand

Undefeated
Every battle You’ve won

I am who You say I am
You crown me with confidence

I am seated, in the heavenly place
Undefeated, by the power of Your name

I am seating, in the heavenly place

 The Maker of the universe 
 Born as a man
 From the start of time 
 I've been on your mind




There's no greater love than this
 None that I could find
 That You would give Your life for mine
 



As I knew You, I was glad
 Everything I desired, I saw You had
 The more I knew You
 The more I fell in love with You
 But still, You love me more




I never feel lonely because of You
 You're always with me all the time
 If I'm in need I just
 Cry out to You
 You will hear me and be by my side
I never feel lonely because of You

Title: Christmas In Our Hearts

Whenever I see girls and boys 
 Selling lanterns on the streets 
 I remember the Child
 In the manger as He sleeps


Wherever there are people
 Giving gifts, exchanging cards 
 I believe that Christmas 
 Is truly in their hearts
 



Let's light our Christmas trees
 For a bright tomorrow
 Where nations are at peace
 And all are one in God



Let's sing Merry Christmas
 And a happy holiday 
 This season, may we never forget 
 The love we have for Jesus



Let Him be the One to guide us
 As another new year starts 
 And may the spirit of Christmas 
 Be always in our hearts



In every prayer and every song
 The community unites
 Celebrating the birth
 Of our Saviour, Jesus Christ



Let love, like that starlight 
 On that first Christmas morn
 Lead us back to the manger 
 Where Christ, the Child was born
 



So, come let us rejoice 
 Come and sing a Christmas carol
 With one big joyful voice 
 Proclaim the name of the Lord!
 


Title: Christmas Isn't Christmas

Christmas isn't Christmas
 Till it happens to your heart
 Somewhere deep inside you
 Is where Christmas really starts



So give your heart to Jesus
 You'll discover when you do
 That is Christmas, really Christmas, for you



Jesus brings warmth like winter's fire
 A light a candle's glow
 He's waiting now to come inside
 As He did so long ago



Jesus brings gifts of Truth and Life
 And makes them bloom and grow
 So welcome Him with the song of joy
 And when He comes, you'll know

 Empty me of all the empty things
 That I hold onto
 Come and fill my heart with You




I need You in my life
 Need You like the air that I breathe
 You've become the very heart of me




 And I
 I can't believe my eyes
 Can't believe the dream that I've found
 Lord, Your love has turned my world around

 'Till I'm like You are
 So deep inside of me

 Draw from my well that never shall run dry

 Come and quench this thirsting of my soul



Bread of Heaven
 Feed me till I want no more
 Fill my cup 
 Fill it up and make me whole




There are millions in this world who are seeking
 For pleasures earthly goods afford
 But none can match the wondrous treausres
 That i can find in Jesus Christ my Lord

 If the things that this world gives you
 Leave hungers that won't pass away
 My blessed Lord will come and save you
 If you kneel to Him and humbly pray

 使被掳得自由

 Leave us abandoned to Your praise
 使我消失在赞美中

 Lord, let Your glory fall
 愿你荣耀降临

Title: Cornerstone

My hope is built on nothing less
 Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame
 But wholly trust in Jesus' name



CHORUS:
 Christ alone
 Cornerstone
 Weak made strong, in the Saviour's love
 Through the storm
 He is Lord, Lord of All



When darkness seems to hide His face
 I rest on His unchanging grace
 In every high and stormy gale
 My anchor holds within the veil
 My anchor holds within the veil 



Then He shall come with trumpets sound
 Oh, may I then in Him be found
 Dressed in His righteousness alone
 Faultless, stand before the throne

愿我得以被提在祂里面

Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless, stand before the throne 
单单居住在祂公义中
无瑕疵站立祂宝座前

Title: Could I Ever

When I woke up today
 I thought of all the things You'd done
 And I find myself here
 Feeling oh, so overcome



PRE-CHORUS:
 You gave Your life away for me
 Truly my heart belongs to You
 So let me say




CHORUS:
 How could I ever thank You for
 What You did at Calvary
 When You bled and died for me
 



Could I ever turn away
 Knowing that You paid the price
 That I could never pay
 




When I think of the way
 That You died upon that Cross
 Bearing my sin
 Even though my heart was lost




Title: Count Your Blessings

 When upon life's billows
 You are tempest tossed
 When you are discouraged thinking
 All is lost



Count your many blessings
 Name them one by one
 And it will surprise you what
 The Lord hath done
 




CHORUS:
 Count your blessings
 Name them one by one
 Count your blessings
 See what God hath done




 Count your blessings

Are you ever burdened
 With a load of care
 Does the cross seem heavy
 You are called to bear




Count your many blessings
 Every doubt will fly
 And you will be singing
 As the days go by




  When you look at others
 With their lands and gold
 Think that Christ has promised
 You His wealth untold
 




Count your many blessings
 Money cannot buy
 Your reward in heaven
 Nor your home on high



So amid the conflict
 Whether great or small
 Do not be discouraged
 God is over all



Count your many blessings
 Angels will attend
 Help and comfort give you
 To your journey's end



Title: Count Your Blessings (数主恩典)

 若数主的恩典  疑惑便消除
必能叫你希奇 感谢而欢呼
 Count your many blessings 
Every doubt will fly
 And you will be singing

不必贪恋他人物质上丰富
 若想主的应许 心中就满足
When you look at others with their lands and gold
Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold


 你所得的恩典  非金钱能买
 活在父亲家里时 蒙他眷爱
 Count your many blessings
 Money cannot buy
Your reward in heaven nor your home on high


 每逢遭遇心灵  各样大争战
 不要为此丧胆因主已得胜
 So amid the conflict whether great or small
 Do not be discouraged God is over all

  刚强壮胆 凡事得胜而有余

Through all eternity

Let every throne before Him fall

The King of kings, O come adore
Our God who reigns forever - more

Crown Him Lord of life
Who triumphed o'er the grave

And rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save

His glories now we sing

And lives that death may die

All hail, Redeemer, hail
For He has died for me

His praise and glory shall not fail
Throughout eternity

 You're my secret place

 Could You carry me through
 If I open my heart
 Could I go there with You




For I've been here before
 But I know there's still more
 Oh, Lord, I need to know You
 




 For what do I have 
 If I don't have You, Jesus
 What in this life 
 Could mean any more

 You are my glory
 You are the lifter 
 Of my head
 Lifter of this head

 Shining like the sun, at the trumpet's call

 So, lift your voice It's the year of Jubilee

 The dry bones becoming as flesh

 And these are the days of Your servant, David
 Rebuilding a temple of praise

 The fields are all white in Your world

 And we are the laborers in Your vineyard

If I have wounded any soul today
 If I have caused one foot to go astray
 If I have walked in my own wilful way
 Dear Lord, forgive


If I have uttered idle words or vain
 If I have turned void from want or pain
 Lest I offend some other through the strain
 Dear Lord, forgive


If I have been perverse, or hard or cold,
 If I have long for shelter in the fold
 When Thou has given me some fort to hold
 Dear Lord, forgive


Forgive the sins I have confessed to Thee
 Forgive the secret sins I do not see
 O guide me, love me and my keeper be
 Dear Lord, Amen

Title: Default

Title: Depths of your Love

 Before the earth
 Before all days
 You knew me



 Formed in Your image
 Made in Your likeness
 You love me



  The light of Your word
 The truth of Your promise guides me



  The power of Your mercy
 The love of Your grace
 Deep inside of me



It's the depths of Your love
 Moving in the depths of me



I believe
 In the power of Your name
 I believe
 In the promise of faith



I believe
 In the love of a God
 Jesus my Saviour
 I believe, I believe



Speak into this mountain
 To move into the ocean
 With Your authority
 Given to me



No matter what happened
 Here I am standing
 On the hope of Your word
 Promised to me



Title: Desert Song

 This is my prayer in the desert
 And all that's within me feels dry
 This is my prayer in my hunger and need
 My God is the God who provides



And this is my prayer in the fire
 In weakness or trial or pain
 There is a faith proved
 With more worth than gold



So refine me, Lord
 Through the flames



And I will bring praise
 I will bring praise
 No weapon formed against me
 Shall remain



I will rejoice
 I will declare
 God is my victory
 And He is here



And this is my prayer in the battle
 And triumph is still on its way
 I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ
 So firm on His promise I stand



 This is my prayer in the harvest
 When favour and providence flow
 I know I'm filled to be empty again
 The seed I've received, I will sow



All of my life
 In every season
 You are still God
 I have a reason to sing
 I have a reason to worship

Title: Devoted

Lord, I'm falling deeper in love with You
 In love with You
 Here, here in our presence,
 I choose to give my life to You



You gave Your life completely for me
 Paying the price so I can be free
 Now it's my time to give it to You



 I choose to be devoted to You
 I bring my gift, a heart of sacrifice for You
 I'm taking Your hand
 I'll follow the feet that once were pierced for me



Treasure found in the secret place
 Never ending joy
 Healing flows from 
 Your throne of grace
 Love restores my soul



Consume me, fill me
 Saturate my soul
 Consume me, fill me
 Come and make me whole



Title: Devoted to You

All I want is to see Your face
 Shining down on me
 All I want is to touch Your heart

 My heart is wholly consumed 
 By Your love




I lay down my whole life 
 To bring You praise
 I am wholly devoted to You

 Healing flows from Your throne of grace

Title: Devotion

I've been running, trying to be one who sees
 I've been working, salvation out on my knees
 There is nothing better tha nknowing
 We are redeemed


I'm believing, trusting in creative hands
 I am praying for our world to bow to Your plan
 And this one though is unmistakable
 To take up my cross and follow You, Lord




When You stand, the tall trees and mountains bow
 When You speak, the fiercest of oceans is still
 And I see the sinner seek devotion
 The lost become chosen, and I fall to my knees




I'm forgiven by a Saviour who did not deserve death
 He was blameless and I was lost in shamefulness
 I'm delivered but it doesn't seem right
 Unless I keep my eyes focused on
 The Saviour who gave His life



In the middle of a world that denies it believes
 It is breaking apart at the very seams
 There is one thing to be alive for
 And it's to take up my cross and follow You, Lord




Fall to my knees


Title: Did You Ever Talk To God Above

Did you ever talk to God above
 Tell Him that you need a friend to love
 Pray in Jesus' name 
 Believing that God answers prayer



Have you told Him
 All your cares and woes
 Ev'ry tiny little fear, He knows
 You can know He'll always hear
 And He will answer prayer



You can whisper in a crowd to Him
 You can cry when you're alone to Him
 You don't have to pray out loud to Him
 He knows your thoughts



On a lofty mountain peak, He's there
 In a meadow by a stream, He's there
 Anywhere on earth you go
 He's been there from the start




 Find the answer in His word; it's true
 You'll be strong because
 He walks with you
 By His faithfulness 
 He'll change you too
 God answers prayer

 There's someone loving you
 He lives in me
 And other people too



 Did you know
 He died on the cross
 Did you know

 For everything You've done
 He loved me
 Gave His only Son
 To die on the cross for my sin
 To die on the cross for my sin

 And He'll be back again

 I know You're on the throne

 



Let them see the God they need
 With the fire that burns in me
 Let me make a difference for You my God

 You've set me free

 My glorious King (this is...)
 My destiny

 Come and burn in me
 Cleanse my heart from sin

 From the inside out
 So that the world won't doubt (that You are God)

 We're living in a season
 Of amazing grace

 Born for this hour
 And we will be willing
 In the day of His pow'r

 That the prophecies fulfilled
 Now a Holy Ghost revival
 Is gonna gather every field




Though the mountains tremble
 Though the oceans roar
 All the earth will be filled
 With the glory of the Lord

Title: Do It Again (Elevation Worship)

Walking around these walls
 I thought by now they'd fall

 But You have never failed me yet

Waiting for change to come
Knowing the battle's won 

For You have never failed me yet

Your promise still stands
 Great is Your faithfulness, Your faithfulness

 I'm still in Your hands
 This is my confidence You've never failed me

I know the night won't last
 Your Word will come to pass

 My heart will sing Your praise again

Jesus You're still enough
Keep me within Your love 

My heart will sing Your praise again

I've seen You move
 You move the mountains

Before You God

So let all the earth rejoice 
In who You are


Do it again, do it again

Title: Down From His Glory

 Down from His glory, ever living story
 My God and Saviour came and Jesus was His name


 Born in a manger, so His own a stranger
 A man of sorrows, tears and agony


 O how I love Him, and how I adore Him My breath, my Saviour, my all in all


 The great Saviour became my all in all And all God's fullness dwelleth in Him


 What a condescension, bringing us redemption That in the dead of night, not one faint hope in sight


 God, gracious, tender, laid aside His splendor Stooping to woo, to win, to save my soul


 Without reluctance, Flesh and blood His substance He took the form of man, revealed the hidden pain


 O glorious mystery, sacrifice of Calvary And now I know thou art the Great I AM

 Please burn in me
 A heart that dreams

Title: ENSEMBLE (CHRISTMAS)

I am driving, on my way to work

Glad I worked hard climbing up the ladder

I'll go higher, just like how I did before

Good morning, Aiden

Don't know if you have heard

Boss is waiting to see your latest work

I can see, you are getting that promotion

Everything's going well like I planned

Nothing can stop me, I must believe in me

I think I must work harder

He's successful

Can he still go higher

Who can depend on him

Everybody, everyone

How much higher can he go

All the way up

I'm successful

Just like how I wanted

Good job, big house

Happy family, happy life

I think I am winning life and in control

I should be happy, I should be satisfied

I have a family, and a job that pays

But the weight of keeping up is no child's play

The food is ready

I've cooked your favourite dish

Dad is waiting for you to see that bill

And your mom

She's asking about some medication

Everything's always on my plate

Nothing can stop this life I live in repeat

I think I'm going under

You're successful

I know but I'm tired

Who can depend on him

Everybody, everywhere

How much higher can he go

All the way up

Nine to five just getting by

Six to ten he's at it again

When has life become a race that never ends

Work and work to get him higher

He tries to keep his head above the water

Can't catch a break, not a single mistake

'cause they are counting on him

Counting on him

I should be happy everything's fine

Three simple rules

I'll try to get by

Got nobody else

But me, myself and I

Title: Face To Face

Here, now
 This is the moment
 Speak now


I'm out in the open
 With emptied hands
 I reach again



These walls are
 Finally falling
 The space



Between us is closing
 My heart gives way
 To perfect grace



I'm drawing closer than ever before
 You've patiently waited
 And now I am sure, Jesus
 I lay my defenses down
 'Cause I just want You now



My fears concede
 To Your sureness
 My shame melts



 Away in Your brilliance
 And now I see
 You're all I need



Always faithful
 You welcome me home
 And my heart will praise You
 My God, my reward



Jesus
 I lay my defenses down
 'Cause I just want You now
 'Cause I just want You now

 Me in the eye
 I know
 You just want me now

So I give You the highest praise
 And I'll worship for all my days
 When I look You in the eye
 I know



I just want You now

Title: Fairest Lord Jesus

Fairest Lord Jesus, Ruler of all nature,

O Thou of God and man the Son,

Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor,

Thou, my soul's glory, joy and crown.

Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands,

Robed in the blooming garb of spring;

Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer,

Who makes the woeful heart to sing.

Fair is the sunshine,

Fairer still the moonlight,

And all the twinkling starry host;

Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer

Than all the angels heaven can boast.

Beautiful Savior! Lord of all the nations!

Son of God and Son of Man!

Glory and honor, praise, adoration,

Now and forever more be Thine.

Title: Faith

I'm reaching for the prize
 I'm giving everything
 I give my life for this
 It's what I live for






Nothing will keep me from
 All that You have for me
 You hold my head up high
 I live for You
 





Greater is He that's living in me
 Than he that is in the world




 CHORUS:
 Faith
 I can move the mountain
 I can do all things through Christ
 I know




Faith
 Standing and believing
 I can do all things through Christ
 Who strengthens me

Faith
 Standing and believing

I can do all things through Christ
 Who strengthens me

Title: Faith Like That

I have read about the days of old
 About the men who followed You
 And how they saw the supernatural
 And became the chosen few



So I come before You now
 Tearing off my earthly crowns
 For this one thing I have found



CHORUS 1:
 I want a faith like that
 To see the dead rise or
 To see You pass by, oh, I
 




I want a faith like that
 Whatever the cost,
 I'll suffer the loss, oh, I
 I want a faith like that



I'm not looking for a miracle
 Signs and wonders or things thereof
 I caught a glimpse of what
 You want for me
 And what I have is not enough




I read the story one more time
 Of those who gave to You their lives
 With no fear or compromise
 




CHORUS 2:
 I want a faith
 That can move any mountain
 And send them to the seas




I want a faith
 That can break every stronghold
 That keeps You
 That keeps You from me
 



And I want a faith like that
 To see the dead rise or
 To see You pass by, oh I
 




I want a faith like that
 A faith like that



Title: Faithful

 I stand before You
 Run into Your arms
 Your everlasting love
 Is in my heart



Now I've got a future
 Written with hope
 Your goodness rains down
 Wherever I go
 




 Your word is true
 It cannot lie
 I can do all things
 When I'm by Your side




You will never leave me
 Or bring me harm
 I'll shout it from the mountains
 That You are




CHORUS:
 Faithful is the Lord our God
 Your love shines down
 Your love shines down



Faithful is the Lord our God
 We join with all the heavens
 Singing faithful is our God



 BRIDGE:
 Faithful is our God



Title: Faithful God

This I'll testify
 'Til I see it with my eyes
 Your word is true, my God
 You cannot lie
 (Repeat)



I would have despaired
 Unless I had believed
 I'd see Your goodness
 But Your word says 
 Your mercy will
 Follow me all my days




 And I would have despaired
 Unless I had believed 
 I'd see Your glory
 But I know if I'm seeking
 You promised that I'd see Your face
 




My faithful God
 My faithful God



Title: Faithful God (Every Promise Kept)

 May the grace that sought
 My heart on that first day
 Be the grace that binds
 My heart to stay



May the truth that opened up
 My eyes on that first time
 Be the thoughts on my mind
 That never go away




For You are a lamp to my feet
 A light to my path
 You're the hand that's holding me




Faithful God
 Every promise kept
 Every need You've met
 Faithful God




 All I am and all I'll ever be 
 Is all because You love faithfully
 Faithful God



 May the love that caught
 My heart to set it free
 Be the love that others see in me




And may this hope that reaches
 To the depths of human need
 Be the song that I sing in
 Joy and suffering




 For You are the love that never leaves
 The friend that won't deceive
 You're the one sure thing




How deep, how wide the love
 That pierced His side, the love
 Redemption's mine, oh love
 That will not let me go


Title: Faithful God (I Serve)

 His faithfulness prevails
 Lord, I put my trust in You

 In Your faithfulness
 Yes, I serve a faithful God

 If I call, will You come 
 When I cry, do You hear 
 I believe every tear 
 Is caught up by a faithful God


 So I will cry until You come 
 Cast my cares into Your arms 
 I can't see past this storm 
 But I'm counting on a faithful God 



CHORUS: 
 Faithful God 
 You hold my life secure 
 All my days are Yours 



 I believe 
 My God is like a fire defending me 
 Faithfully 



I believe You still heal 
 And demons still bow 
 I'm convinced there is power 
 In trusting in a faithful God



 So I will praise till You appear 
 And set Your foot upon this shore 
 I declare that every foe 
 Is subject to my faithful God 



 BRIDGE:
 I know that You are mine 
 And I am Yours, I am Yours 
 I know Your faithfulness 
 It will endure, it will endure

Title: FAMILY (CHRISTMAS)

Are you okay?

What is going through your mind?

Why don't you tell me?

I thought everything was right

And it was just

You were tired from your work

And things were just fine

You were getting busier

But I couldn't let you know this

As I tried to hold on

It's a duty that I shoulder

I should never fall

I can't see how things could change for the better

Because I've lost hope

What can be changed for good?

I don't know how things could change for the better

Because I failed you

Because things fell through

How can we go on from here?

Have we been piling all our hopes and dreams on him

Thinking his success came easily

Did we fail to see what he really needs

All I wanted was to give you nothing but the best

I wish I could have been for you

A better mom

I did not mean to pressure him

I'm just so proud of his achievements

But with all that stripped away

We're still the proudest we can be

 Of the fountain of life
 My children will know they are mine

 I am the Lord
 Their share I have taken away
 My Spirit will lead them the way

 A light to the world they will be
 Life shall come forth from the Father above
 My body will set mankind free

Title: Five Loaves And Two Fishes

A little boy of thirteen
 Was on his way to school
 He heard a crowd of people laughing
 And he went to take a look



 Thousands were listening
 To the stories of one man
 He spoke with such wisdom
 Even the kids could understand



 The hours passed so quickly
 The day turned to night
 Everyone was hungry
 But there was no food in sight



The boy looked in his lunchbox
 At the little that he had
 He wasn't sure what good it'd do
 There were thousands to be fed




But he saw the twinkling eyes of Jesus
 The kindness in His smile
 And the boy cried out
 With the trust of a child
 He said



CHORUS 1:
 Take my five loaves and two fishes
 Do with it as You will, I surrender
 Take my fears and inhibitions
 All my burdens, my ambitions
 You can use it all
 To feed them all


I often think about that boy
 When I'm feeling small
 And I worry that the work I do
 Means nothing at all




But every single tear I cry
 Is a diamond in His hands
 And every door that slams in my face
 I will offer up in prayer




BRIDGE:
 So I'll give You every breath that I have
 Oh Lord, You can work miracles
 All that You need is my "Amen"



CHORUS 2:
 Take my five loaves and two fishes
 Do with it as You will, I surrender
 Take my fears and inhibitions
 All my burdens, my ambitions
 You can use it all
 I hope it's not too small
 I trust in You 
 I trust in You



Take my five loaves and two fishes
 Do with it as You will, I surrender
 Take my fears and inhibitions
 All my burdens, my ambitions
 You can use it all
 No gift is too small




Title: Flow Through Me

CHORUS:
 Flow through me
 Flow through me
 So that I can worship You
 In true reality



Flow through me
 Flow through me
 So that I can come
 Into Your holy place

Title: Forever (He Is Alive)

The moon and stars they wept
 The morning sun was dead
 The Saviour of the world was fallen



His body on the cross
 His blood poured out for us
 The weight of every curse upon Him



One final breath He gave
 As heaven looked away
 The Son of God was laid in darkness




 A battle in the grave
 The war on death was waged
 The power of hell forever broken
 




 The ground began to shake
 The stone was rolled away
 His perfect love could not be overcome



 Now death where is your sting
 Our resurrected King
 Has rendered you defeated




Forever He is glorified
 Forever He is lifted high
 Forever He is risen
 He is alive, He is alive




We sing Hallelujah
 We sing Hallelujah

 The Lamb has overcome

Title: Gemstone

 Do you have a name
 How long will it remain
 Who decides the purpose
 Others or Jesus



 Do you feel alone
 Despite the smiles
 You've shown
 Searching for an answer
 To last through this season
 



Looking at Your heart
 It's being broken apart
 Yearning for true love
 Searching for it's worth



Looking at Your heart
 It's being broken apart
 Yearning for true love
 Searching for it's worth



Pre-Chorus:
 When no one's around 
 To ease your pain
 None to shelter you from the rain
 Don't you know He hears your cry
 And everything inside
 


Do we run around in circles
 Giving in to the world
 Jesus gave His life for us
 As a symbol of His love



The compass to your identity
 His love will set you free
 Shall we spread our wings and fly
 To leave our doubts behind
 



Don't run around in circles
 Don't give in to the world
 Jesus gave His life for you
 As a symbol of His love
 



 You are a jewel, in the eyes
 Of the maker of earth and skies
 When the world sees a common face
 God only sees His chosen race

Title: GETHSEMANE SONG- FATHER I PRAY

The time has come, when those I trust
Will reveal who they really are

To my enemy, he will sell me out
And my beloved, he will disown me

Father I pray that this cup in my hands
Be taken away from me

But if Father You say there’s no other way
Than for me to die on the cross

To save a world that’s lost 

The time has come, for me to face
The greatest trial of my soul

I’ll be mocked and scorned

I will suffer for
The sins of this world on the cross

Father I pray that this cup in my hands
Be taken away from me

But if Father You say there’s no other way
Than for me to die on the cross

To save a world that’s lost 

Father, if this is Your will, 
let it be done

Though anguish and sorrow is churning inside 
I’ll choose to exchange my life for their life 

For I love them so dearly
I’ll die so that they may live on

Father I pray that this cup in my hands
Be wholly devoted to You

And if Father You say there’s no other way
Then I’ll give my life on the cross

I’ll save a world that’s lost

Title: Give My Life Away

I've seen Your face
 Your heart and soul
 One who gave all
 He had for me



 I've seen the passion
 Of His death
 And the forgiveness
 In His final breath
 




Now I can never be the same
 My heart has been
 Forever changed
 I've got to live and love
 And give because He gave




CHORUS:
 Now I'm giving my life away
 Laying it down on the altar




 Now I'm giving my life away
 The very least I can offer
 Is my all
 



So here I stand today
 Giving my life away
 




No earthly price
 Could be too great
 No sacrifice
 Too much to make




 The way of
 Measuring the cost
 Is to the blood
 Of Calvary's Cross




So if I live, I live for Him
 Or if I die, I count it gain
 My life is not my own
 But His from this day on

Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day

Now Your mercy has saved my soul
Now Your freedom is all that I know

The old made new
Jesus, when I met You

I needed rescue my sin was heavy
But chains break at the weight of Your glory

I needed shelter, I was an orphan
Now You call me a citizen of Heaven 

When I was broken, You were my healing
Now Your love is the air that I’m breathing

I have a future, my eyes are open
‘Cause when You called my name

 Remember Christ, our Saviour
 Was born on Christmas day



To save us all from Satan's power
 When we were gone astray
 O tidings of comfort and joy

 This blessed Babe was born
 And laid within the manger
 Upon this blessed morn



That which His mother Mary
 Did nothing take in scorn
 O tidings of comfort and joy
 Comfort and joy
 O tidings of comfort and joy




 From God, our heavenly Father
 A blessed angel came
 And unto certain shepherds
 Brought tidings of the same




How that in Bethlehem was born
 The Son of God by name
 O tidings of comfort and joy
 Comfort and joy
 O tidings of comfort and joy



The shepherds at this tidings
 Rejoiced much in mind
 And left their flocks a feeding
 In tempest storm and wind
 




And went to Bethlehem straight way
 The blessed Babe to find
 O tidings of comfort and joy
 Comfort and joy
 O tidings of comfort and joy

By the power of Jesus' blood, That was shed for me

Title: He Looked Beyond My Faults

Amazing grace
 Shall always be
 My song of praise
 For it was grace
 That bought my liberty



I do not know just why
 He came to love me so
 He looked beyond
 My faults and saw my needs
 



CHORUS:
 I shall forever
 Lift my eyes to Calvary
 To view the Cross
 Where Jesus died for me
 



How marvellous Thy grace
 That saved my falling soul
 He looked beyond
 My faults and saw my needs

Title: He Shall Reign Forevermore

In the bleak mid-winter
 All creation groans
 For a world in darkness
 Frozen like a stone



Light is breaking
 In a stable
 For a throne




And He shall reign 
 Forevermore, forevermore
 And He shall reign
 Forevermore, forevermore




 Unto us a child is born
 The King of kings and Lord of lords
 And He shall reign
 Forevermore, forevermore




If I were a wise man
 I would travel far
 And if I were a shepherd
 I would do my part




But poor as I am
 I will give to Him my heart
 Here within a manger lies
 The One who made the starry skies




This baby born for sacrifice
 Christ, the Messiah
 Into our hopes, into our fears
 The Savior of the world appears




 The promise of eternal years
 Christ
 The Messiah


Title: He Touched Me

 Shackled by a heavy burden,
 'Neath a load of sin and shame
 Then the hand of Jesus touched me
 And now I am no longer the same



CHORUS:
 He touched me, oh He touched me
 And oh, the joy that floods my soul
 Something happened and now I know
 He touched me and made me whole



Since I met this blessed Saviour
 Since He cleansed and made me whole
 I will never cease to praise Him
 I'll shout it while eternity rolls


Title: He Turned My Mourning

 He turned my mourning into dancing
 He turned my sorrow into joy
 A song of praise instead of sadness
 And for our grief the oil of joy
 



CHORUS:
 That we might be trees of righteousness
 The planting of the Lord
 That He might be
 That He might be, glorified
 (Repeat)

Title: Heart Of Worship

When the music fades
 All is stripped away

 And I simply come

Longing just to bring
 Something that's of worth

 That will bless Your heart


 I'll bring You more than a song
 For a song in itself

 Is not what You have required

 You search much deeper within
 Through the way things appear

 You're looking into my heart


 I'm coming back to
 The heart of worship

 When it's all about You
 It's all about You, Jesus

 I'm sorry, Lord 
 For the things I've made it

 It's all about You, Jesus

King of endless worth

 How much You deserve

Though I'm weak and poor
 All I have is Yours

 Every single breath

I'll bring You more than a song
I'll bring You more than a song

 It's all about You
 Jesus

 All my failings sure
 They would have drowned me
 Still You made a way

 Where would I be without You
 Here in my life, here in my life

 Sing for joy at one
 Who finds the way to freedom
 Truth of Jesus
 Bought from death into His life

 Through the eyes of Your grace
 Though the cost was 
 Your beloved for me
 Still You made a way

Title: Here is love

Here is love, vast as the ocean,

Lovingkindness as the flood,

When the Prince of Life, our Ransom,

Shed for us His precious blood.

Who His love will not remember?

Who can cease to sing His praise?

He can never be forgotten,

Throughout heav'n's eternal days.

On the mount of crucifixion,

Fountains opened deep and wide;

Through the floodgates of God's mercy

Flowed a vast and gracious tide.

Grace and love, like mighty rivers,

Poured incessant from above,

And heav'n's peace and perfect justice

Kissed a guilty world in love.

Let me all Thy love accepting,

Love Thee, ever all my days;

Let me seek Thy kingdom only

And my life be to Thy praise;

Thou alone shalt be my glory,

Nothing in the world I see.

Thou hast cleansed and sanctified me,

Thou Thyself hast set me free.

In Thy truth Thou dost direct me

By Thy Spirit through Thy Word;

And Thy grace my need is meeting,

As I trust in Thee, my Lord.

Of Thy fulness Thou art pouring

Thy great love and power on me,

Without measure, full and boundless,

Drawing out my heart to Thee.

 New heights I'm gaining everyday
 Still praying as I'm onward bound

 Lord, lift me up and let me stand
 By faith on heaven's table land
 A higher plane than I have found
 Lord, plant my feet on higher ground



 My heart has no desire to stay
 Where doubts arise and fears dismay
 Though some may dwell where these abound
 My prayer, my aim 
 Is higher ground



I want to live above the world
 Though satan's darts at me are hurled
 For faith has caught the joyful sound
 The song of saints on higher ground

 And catch a gleam of glory bright
 But still I'll pray till heaven I've found
 Lord, lead me on to higher ground

 His love is warmer

 Softer than a sigh
 His love is deeper 
 Than the deepest ocean
 Wider than the sky


His love is brighter 
 Than the brightest star
 That shines every night above
 And there is nothing in this world
 That can ever change His love



Once I thought that 
 Love was meant for
 Anyone else but me
 Once I thought that 
 No one knew the way



Now that only goes to show 
 How wrong we all can be
 Cause now it seems 
 He loves me more each day



Something happened to my heart 
 The day that I met Him
 Something that I never felt before
 And that something is that 
 He has buried all my sins
 And now it seems 
 I love Him more each day

 When our strength is gone
 He'll carry us when we can't carry on
 Raised in His power

 When ours comes to an end
 He hears our humble cry and proves again

 When our strength is gone
 He'll carry us when we can't carry on
 Raised in His power




The weak becomes strong
 His strength is perfect
 His strength is perfect

Title: Holding Nothing Back

Behind this curtain 
 There is a heart that's hurting
 It's been taking a beating
 It's starting to fall apart



And I feel like such an easy target
 Dodging bullets, I'm exhausted
 How can every moment be this hard?




 I'm holding nothing back from You
 Doesn't really matter what I lose
 Got a heart that's open
 I'm broken and I want You to know




 Jesus, I don't want anything 
 Coming in between You and me
 Jesus, it doesn't matter 
 What I have to go through
 I'm holding nothing back
 Nothing back from You



I've got a list that goes on and on
 It's overflowing with memories of everything 
 That I've been doing wrong
 And I'll be the first to say
 I've chased after so many foolish things 
 Looking for a way to kill the pain




I try to do the right things
 Why am I struggling day to day 
 With these same old things?
 Whatever's taking Your place
 I'm getting out of the way
 I'm getting out of the way




Jesus, I don't want anything coming in between
 Jesus, I'll do what I gotta do
 I'm holding nothing back, back from You

 Of a rising generation
 Not afraid of love
 Or dreaming of the future

 And the good things He's done
 Fling wide these gates
 Let's see His kingdom come


 All the people come
 From the ends of the earth
 All the people come
 Lifting their voice
 




 Holy, holy is the Lord
 Holy, holy is the Lord
 Holy, holy is the Lord
 Holy, holy is the Lord

 Falling down before Thee
 Which wert and art
 And ever-more shalt be

 Tho' the darkness hide Thee
 Tho' the eye of sinful man
 Thy glory may not see




Only Thou art holy
 There is none beside Thee
 Perfect in power
 In love, and purity
 




 Holy, holy, holy
 Lord God Almighty
 All Thy works shall praise Thy name
 In earth, and sky, and sea

Title: Hope

Within the still of the night
 I am on flight broken wings
 In the midst of shattered dreams
 You're the hope I'd ever need



A million people pass me by
 Yet, I'm still empty inside
 But in every face 
 I see Your eyes
 Smiling back at me



And there 
 I hear You calling me
 Reaching for my hands
 And yes, I know I'll make it through
 'Cause in Your hands
 In Your embrace
 That's where I belong



Whenever I feel I'm weary
 Whenever I had enough
 I feel like giving up
 You'll be there to see me through


Whenever my soul's in need of rest 
 I find in You
 In silence and in yielding
 I will hear Your tender whispers
 Calling me into Your arms


Title: HOPE HAS A NAME

There is a song, I know it well
A melody that's never failed

On mountains high and valleys low
My soul will rest, my confidence

In You alone

Hope has a name
His name is Jesus

My Saviour's cross 
Has set the sinner free

Hope has a name
His name is Jesus

Oh, Christ be praised
I have victory

There is a light, salvation's flame
Christ undefeated, trampled the grave

See now the cross, be lifted high
The light has come, the light has won

Behold the Christ

There'll be a day
My hope complete

Now home in glory, Your face I'll see
My pain no more, my fear will cease

I bow my life, I fix my eyes
On Christ my King

I bow my life, I fix my eyes
On Christ my King

 Lifting up the name of Jesus 
 A strong tower meant to save us
 And now nothing will defeat us



 We are boldly interceding 
 For our children lost and bleeding
 We'll see slavery bow to freedom
 And the sick restored to healing



  So we fight for those who're mourning
 And take back what was stolen



For our families shamed and broken
 Hope will rise and hearts have been opened



 We'll see joy defeat depression
 Liberation from addiction 
 For when we are at our weakest 
 Your power is completed

Title: How Can I Keep From Singing

My life flows on in endless song;

Above earthâs lamentation

I hear the sweet though far off hymn

That hails a new creation:

Through all the tumult and the strife

I hear the music ringing;

It finds an echo in my soulâ

How can I keep from singing?

What though my joys and comforts die?

The Lord my Savior liveth;

What though the darkness gather round!

Songs in the night He giveth:

No storm can shake my inmost calm

While to that refuge clinging;

Since Christ is Lord of heaven and earth,

How can I keep from singing?

I lift mine eyes; the cloud grows thin;

I see the blue above it;

And day by day this pathway smoothes

Since first I learned to love it:

The peace of Christ makes fresh my heart,

A fountain ever springing:

All things are mine since I am Hisâ

How can I keep from singing?

 You were paying the price
 For my life, for my life

  To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
    To Thy precious, bleeding side.

  By the pow’r of grace divine;
Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,
  And my will be lost in Thine.


	O the pure delight of a single hour
  That before Thy throne I spend,
When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God,
  I commune as friend with friend!

  Ere Thee face to face I see;
There are heights of joy that I yet may reach
  Ere I rest in peace with Thee.

I choose You now

I will praise You 
Through the fire

Through the storm 
And through the flood

There is nothing 
That could ever steal my song

In the valley You are worthy
You are good when life is not

You will always 
And forever be my song

I build my altar 
Right here and now

In the midst of the darkest night 
It won't burn out

For You are perfect
No matter what

In the joy of the suffering
I'll sing it loud

When the enemy says I'm done

I'll lift my praises

Touch Your heart

I heard the bells on Christmas day

Their old familiar carols play,

And wild and sweet the words repeat

Of peace on earth, good will to men.

And thought how, as the day had come,

The belfries of all Christendom

Had rolled along the unbroken song

Of peace on earth, good will to men.

Till ringing, singing on its way

The world revolved from night to day,

A voice, a chime, a chant sublime

Of peace on earth, good will to men.

And in despair I bowed my head

"There is no peace on earth," I said,

"For hate is strong and mocks the song

Of peace on earth, good will to men."

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:

"God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;

The wrong shall fail, the right prevail

With peace on earth, good will to men."

I love to tell the story of unseen things above,

Of Jesus and His glory, of Jesus and His love.

I love to tell the story, because I know 'tis true;

It satisfies my longings as nothing else can do.

I love to tell the story, 'twill be my theme in glory,

To tell the old, old story of Jesus and His love.

I love to tell the story; more wonderful it seems

Than all the golden fancies of all our golden dreams.

I love to tell the story, it did so much for me;

And that is just the reason I tell it now to thee.

I love to tell the story; 'tis pleasant to repeat what seems,

Each time I tell it, more wonderfully sweet.

I love to tell the story, for some have never heard

The message of salvation from God's own holy Word.

I love to tell the story, for those who know it best

Seem hungering and thirsting to hear it like the rest.

And when, in scenes of glory, I sing the new, new song,

'Twill be the old, old story that I have loved so long.

Title: I stand amazed in the presence

I stand amazed in the presence

Of Jesus the Nazarene,

And wonder how He could love me,

A sinner, condemned, unclean.

O how marvelous! O how wonderful!

And my song shall ever be:

O how marvelous! O how wonderful!

Is my Savior's love for me!

For me it was in the garden

He prayed: "Not My will, but Thine."

He had no tears for His own griefs,

But sweat drops of blood for mine.

In pity angels beheld Him,

And came from the world of light

To comfort Him in the sorrows

He bore for my soul that night.

He took my sins and my sorrows,

He made them His very own;

He bore the burden to Calvary,

And suffered and died alone.

Refrain

When with the ransomed in glory

His face I at last shall see,

'Twill be my joy through the ages

To sing of His love for me.

  And my song shall ever be:
  How marvelous! How wonderful!
  Is my Savior’s love for me!

  He had no tears for His own griefs,
  But sweat-drops of blood for mine.


  In pity angels beheld Him,
  And came from the world of light
  To strengthen Him in the sorrows
  He bore for my soul that night.


  He took my sins and my sorrows,
  He made them His very own;
  He bore the burden to Calv’ry,
  And suffered, and died alone.


  When with the ransomed in glory
  His face I at last shall see,
  ’Twill be my joy through the ages
  To sing of His love for me.


Title: I Stand Amazed In The Presence (CHINESE)

  哦 何等奇妙, 何等惊异, 我将永远唱此诗  哦 何等奇妙, 何等惊异, 救主爱我爱无极


 为我他在园中祈求, 只愿神旨得成就 流泪非为自己忧苦, 汗如血点只为我


 他担当我一切罪忧, 甘愿亲自来背负 他背我重担至迦略, 孤单受苦并受死


 当与众圣同进荣耀, 至终亲见他欢颜 这将成我无穷喜乐, 来唱他恩爱无极

 A time will come when everyone Will turn their eyes On the risen Son


 Until that day This world will turn away So, I'll take Your hand I'll always stand for You


 Guilty of disgrace But You took my place Jesus, I'll always stand for You

Title: I'm Forever Yours

 I give my all to You
 Send me and I will go for You
 Till the ends of the earth
 I'll follow after You
 I want the world to know
 Your love endures forever



 Tell me and I'll obey
 This is far greater than sacrifice
 Trust in You and not myself
 Will always lead to blessing
 Lord, have Your way in me
 Not my will, Yours be done



CHORUS:
 Here I stand within Your presence
 Longing for Your touch
 A thousand days cannot compare
 To one day in Your courts
 



Hold me now and never ever let me go
 My Jesus, my precious Saviour
 I'm forever Yours

 And I will worship You forever
 I will worship You


Title: I'm Free

In this world full of sorrow
 How many masks must I wear
 It's getting tiring with each passing day
 Yet freedom from whom can I find



 I looked everywhere
 Yet empty I'm left
 But finally I've come to know


 No longer lowly
 No longer bland
 I'm now free to be who I am
 



No longer confused
 No longer blank
 Cause You've told me who I am



Now I'm free from sin
 Free to love
 Now I'm free to be
 Free to dream


Title: I'm Free, I'm Free

I'm free
 I'm free
 I'm free to be a servant
 Of the Lord
 (Repeat)




He taught me how to praise Him
 He taught me how to sing His song
 He taught me how to love...
 I'm free to be a servant
 Of the Lord



Title: I'm Gonna sing, sing, sing (我要高声唱)

我高声唱, 唱，唱，

 我要坐在主身旁
 我要唱我要喊, 赞美主

I'm held by Your love
 Upheld by Your strength
 On Your shoulders You bore me
 By Your faith I stand
 



Cherished by You, Lord
 Treasured in Your sight
 So close to Your heart
 Held firm in Your hand



So awesome is Your love
 So mighty is Your hand
 On eagle's wings You carry me
 Your grace shall be my strength


 So perfect is Your love
 You sacrificed Your Son
 Amazing love reached out to me
 With joy to You I come



 Not by my wisdom
 Not by my strength
 Gently You guide me
 Lead me by hand



 Total surrender
 Jesus, I am Yours
 Now and forever
 In Christ I now stand


Title: I'm In Love With You

Can I sing You a song 
Can I pour out my heart

Just a glimpse of Your grace 
And my whole world is changed 

Forever and completely

I’m in love with You
I’m in love with You

Redeemed
Made whole

Poured out over my soul

Restored, I am made new 
Father You, only You

Title: I'm Still Standing

You gave me courage to believe
 That all Your goodness I would see

 And if it had not been for You
 Standing on my side

 Where would I be

If not for Your goodness
 If not for Your grace

 I don’t know where I would be today
 If not for Your kindness

 I never could say I’m still standing

 If not for Your mercy
 If not for Your love

 I most likely would have given up
 If not for Your favour

 I never could say I’m still standing
 But by the grace of God

To You, I lift my offering
 And set my heart on higher things

 For if it had not been for You 
 Standing on my side

 Where would I be

I'm still standing
I'm still standing

 I'm still standing
 But by the grace of God

I'm still praising
I'm still praising

 I'm still praising
 But by the grace of God

 I'm not my own
 My life is Yours

Title: Imagine Me Without You

 As long as stars 
 Shine down from heaven
 And the rivers run into the sea
 Till the end of time forever
 You're the only love I'll need



In my life
 You're all that matters
 In my eyes
 The only truth I see



When my hopes
 And dreams have shattered
 You're the One that's there for me



PRE-CHORUS:
 When I found You
 I was blessed
 And I will never leave You
 I need You



CHORUS:
 Imagine me without You
 I'd be lost and so confused
 I wouldn't last a day
 I'd be afraid 
 Without You there 
 To see me through



Imagine me without You
 Lord, You know it's just impossible
 Because of You
 It's all brand new
 My life is now worthwhile
 I can't imagine me without You


When You caught me, I was falling
 Your love lifted me back on my feet
 It was like You heard my calling
 And You rushed to set me free

 My hope is found
 He is my light, my strength, my song

 The fiercest drought and storm


 What height of love 
 What depths of peace


  When fears are stilled
 When strivings cease


 My Comforter
 My all in all
 Here in the love of Christ

 In Christ alone who took on flesh
 Fullness of God in helpless babe

 Scorned by the ones 
 He came to save




 Till on that Cross as Jesus died
 The wrath of God was satisfied


 For every sin on Him was laid
 Here in the death of Christ I live


There in the ground His body lay
 Light of the world by darkness slain



 Then bursting forth in glorious day
 Up from the grave He arose again






 And as He stands in victory
 Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
 






 For I am His and He is mine
 Bought with the precious 
 Blood of Christ
 




 No guilt in life
 No fear in death
 This is the power of Christ in me




 From life's first cry to final breath
 Jesus commands my destiny




 No power of hell
 No scheme of man
 Can ever pluck me from His hand



 Till He returns or calls me home
 Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

Title: In The Name Of The Lord (2L)

The crowds have lined the narrow streets
To see this man from Galilee

Just a carpenter some say
Leading fools astray

Yet many kneel to give Him praise

And in His eye
There glimpse the power

That sees the hearts of all men

He speaks His Father's words

For He comes
In the name of the Lord

There is strength

When there's nothing left to do

But just depend on You
And the power of Your name

 And when we call upon Your name

Your strength through weakness to show

We can know the Master's plan
Extend the Master's hand

When we come
In the name of the Lord

His name will be worshipped forever
Creator, Redeemer and King

You took all my sins upon Yourself
I can only stand amazed

And I cry holy, holy, holy God
How awesome is Your name

Holy, holy, holy God
How majestic is Your name

And I am changed
In the presence of a holy God

 In the presence of Your infinite might
 I'm so small and frail and weak

When I glimpse Your power and wisdom, Lord
I have no words left to speak

 In the presence of Your glory
 All my crowns lie in the dust

You are righteous In Your judgements, Lord
 You are faithful, true and just

Title: In Your Presence O God

In Your presence that's where I am strong
 In Your presence, O Lord my God

 In Your presence
 That's where I belong

 Seeking Your face
 Touching Your grace

 In the cleft of the rock
 In Your presence, O God

 I want to go
 Where the rivers

  Cannot overflow me
 Where my feet are on the Rock

I want to hide
 Where the blazing fire

 Cannot burn me
 In Your presence, O God

I want to hide
 Where the flood of evil

 Cannot reach me
 Where I'm covered by the blood

 I want to be
 Where the schemes of darkness

  Cannot touch me
 In Your presence, O God

You are my firm foundation
 I trust in You all day long

  I am Your child and Your servant
 And You are my strength and my song

Title: Indescribable

From the highest of heights 
 To the depths of the sea
 Creation's revealing Your majesty



 From the colors of fall 
 To the fragrance of spring
 Every creature unique in the song 
 That it sings
 All exclaiming



CHORUS:
 Indescribable, uncontainable,
 You placed the stars in the sky
 And You know them by name
 You are amazing God



All powerful, untameable,
 Awestruck we fall to our knees 
 As we humbly proclaim
 You are amazing God



Who has told every lightning bolt 
 Where it should go
 Or seen heavenly storehouses 
 Laden with snow



 Who imagined the sun 
 And gives source to its light
 Yet conceals it to bring us 
 The coolness of night
 None can fathom



Incomparable, unchangeable
 You see the depths of my heart 
 And You love me the same
 You are amazing God
 You are amazing God



Title: Inside Of Me

 What a joy I've found
 Since You filled me with Your Spirit
 You took me
 And You gave me liberty



What a peace I've known
 Since You made my heart Your home
 You changed my life
 And now I've been set free



CHORUS:
 I've got destiny and purpose
 I've got everything I need
 'Cause His love is everlasting
 And His Spirit sets me free



I've got joy that lasts forever
 And a peace you can't conceive
 'Cause Jesus
 He lives inside of me

Title: IT'S CHRISTMAS (2L)

Away in a manger  
No crib for a bed 

The little Lord Jesus 
Laid down His sweet head 

The stars in the sky
Looked down where He lay 

The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing 
The baby awakes 

But little Lord Jesus
No crying He makes 

I love Thee Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky 

And stay by my cradle 
'Til morning is nigh 

It's Christmas
The angels are singing 

And I know the reason
The Saviour is born

 It's Christmas 
The bells are ringing

And I feel like shouting
Joy to the world 

Be near me Lord Jesus
I ask Thee to stay 

Close by me forever
And love me I pray 

Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care 

And fit us for heaven
To live with Thee there 

Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere

Go, tell it on the mountain 
That Jesus Christ is born

 Upon the hill on Calvary He came from Heavens throne Our fallenness and mercy meet Where blood and water flow


 What grace divine, what selflessness That Christ would bear the weight Our proof is scarred on hands that bled That we were worth every nail


 And all the praise and glory to God We sing Hallelujah, sing Hallelujah For the King has carried the cross He is risen from the grave


Beyond the tomb to holy skies He rose in victory And bridged for us the great divide His life is our liberty


 It's Your love It's Your love It's Your love That has saved me


 It's Your blood It's Your blood It's Your blood That has claimed me

Title: Jesus Is Alive

For all the earth had trembled
The sun had hid its face and

All the men that walked with Him
Had turned and run away

 They crucified the Saviour
And laid Him in a tomb the life that once

Brought love and hope
Slipped away that afternoon

Satan gleamed with pleasure
That day at Calvary

For he thought he had won
A mighty victory

And like him all of the demons
Of hell began to cheer

O but little did they know
That their end was growing near

'Cause early Sunday morning
Just like Jesus said

He broke the curse of sin and death
And He rose up from the death

Now we have a new beginning
 And a kingdom that has no ending

 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

Hallelujah
Jesus is alive

Death has lost its victory
And the grave has been denied

Jesus lives forever
He's alive, He's alive

He's the Alpha and Omega
The first and last is He

The curse of sin is broken
And we have perfect liberty

The Lamb of God is risen
He's alive, He's alive

Hallelujah, Jesus is alive

He's the author and
The finisher of our faith

The stone they threw away
Is the cornerstone today

Death has no more victory
And the grave has no more sting

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Wonderful Counsellor
A mighty God is He

The everlasting Father

He's the precious Prince of Peace
He's the Word that lives forever

He's alive
He's alive

 To be called a child of God

 With just one touch
 Every mountain swept away

 In the darkness we were waiting
Without hope, without light

Till from heaven You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes

To fulfil the law and prophets
 To a virgin came the Word

From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt

Praise the Father, Praise the Son 

 Praise the Spirit three in one

God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost 

To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross

For even in Your suffering
You saw to the other side

Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake You died

And the morning that You rose
All of heaven held its breath

Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death

And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe

For the souls of all who’d come
To the Father are restored

And the Church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame

Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel shall not faint

By His blood and in His Name
In His freedom I am free

For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me

In the darkest hours, there on Calvary

Become a crown of glory 
As You died and rose again
成为荣耀的冠冕，当你死而复活

In the darkest hours, in the valley low
I will fear no evil
在最黑暗的时刻，在低谷 
我心无惧邪恶

'Cause You'll never let me go
You'll never let me go
因为你永远不会放手
你永远不会放手

Title: Love Is (Combined)

What is love 
 Is it a splendid thing  
 爱到底是什么



Or a play of empty hearts and broken things  
 I’ve been searching to find  
 是来戏弄和破碎人心么
 我一直在寻找   



 I’ve waited all this time  
 For the perfect one to come along  
 一直在等待  等着完美的那一位 



With pretty words and fancy songs  
 But this dream didn’t seem to survive  
 除了花言巧语  
 这个梦想总是没有实现


 Oh and I know the story well  
 The king came from heaven  
 To rid the world of hell  
 我熟悉那个故事  
 国王怎么下来世界拯救我们 


But more than myth  
 More than words of a distant fairytale  
 但是这不是一个遥远的传说   



CHORUS:  
 It’s in the heart, it’s in the soul  
 It’s more than what the mind can know  
 在我的心，在我的灵  
 超越你所能想象 



It’s found in nail-pierced hands  
 When God became man  
 我看到耶稣钉痕的手



 Forget the rules from Sunday school  
 He doesn’t want your righteous living   
 He wants you  
 不要只顾着外表的形式  
 因为他要得着的是你  



 Your life was bought with His  
 This is what love is  
 他舍命赎回了你  
 这就是爱  



 So over time I realised  
 Human love it fails sometimes  
 我渐渐意识到  
 人的爱不完美  


 So I opened my heart  
 I looked up to this God  
 我敞开心，仰望神  



 But in His ways I strived so hard  
 His love and grace I soon forgot  
 但是仍然靠着自己的能力  
 忘了他的恩典慈爱  



 The more I try   
 The more things seem to fall apart  
 事情没有好转  导致我更加地烦躁  
 



BRIDGE:  
 Hail the King  
 Hail Him who died  
 向君王欢呼  



 He was slain  
 But now He is alive  
 他为我们而死，现在却复活了  



 He’s the anchor of my soul  
 In Him our hearts have found a perfect home  
 他是我灵魂的保障  
 我在他里面找到了归属 


 You’ve won my heart  
 You’ve won my soul  
 With a love no mind could know  
 你赢得了我的心，我的灵  
 你的爱我不能完全理解  



You came with nail-pierced hands   
 And not empty plans  
 You broke the rules to save us fools  
 你带着钉痕的手  打破规则来拯救我们


 You left heaven’s glory 
 Only to be abused 
 你离开天国的荣耀来受苦 You left heaven’s glory 
 Only to be abused 
 你离开天国的荣耀来受苦


You’ve shown me through all of this  
 What love really is  
 你通过这一切让我看到
  什么是爱    


Title: Love Lifted Me

I was sinking deep in sin
 Far from the peaceful shore
 Very deeply stained within
 Sinking to rise no more



 But the Master of the sea
 Heard my despairing cry
 From the waters lifted me
 Now safe am I



CHORUS:
 Love lifted me
 Love lifted me
 When nothing else could help
 Love lifted me



All my heart to Him I give
 Ever to Him I'll cling
 In His blessed presence live
 Ever His praises sing



 Love so mighty and so true
 Merits my soul's best songs
 Faithful, loving service too
 To Him belongs



Souls in danger, look above
 Jesus completely saves
 He will lift you by His love
 Out of the angry waves



 He's the Master of the sea
 Billows His will obey
 He, your Saviour, wants to be
 Be saved today


Title: Love Of Jesus

 Love of Jesus
 Sweet and marvellous
 Love of Jesus
 Sweet and marvellous



 Love of Jesus
 Sweet and marvellous
 Oh, oh, wonderful love



 Higher than the mountain
 Deeper than the ocean
 Wider than the universe
 Oh, oh, wonderful love


Title: Love Ran Red

There's a place where 
 Mercy reigns and never dies,
 There's a place where
 Streams of grace flow deep and wide



Where all the love I've ever found,
 Comes like a flood,
 Comes flowing down



 CHORUS:
 At the cross
 At the cross
 I surrender my life
 I'm in awe of You
 I'm in awe of You



Where Your love ran red
 and my sin washed white
 I owe all to You
 I owe all to You Jesus



There's a place where
 Sin and shame are powerless
 Where my heart has peace 
 With God and forgiveness



Where all the love I've ever found.
 Comes like a flood,
 Comes flowing down



BRIDGE:
 Here my hope is found
 Here on holy ground
 Here I bow down



Here arms open wide
 Here You save my life
 Here I bow down
 Here I bow down 


Title: Love So True (Combined)

Just the other evening
 When the world was sleeping
 就到下一个傍晚
 当世界在睡着



I was lying wide awake
 Imagining your smile
 我清醒地躺着
 幻想着你的笑容
 



Then a breeze that bore your gentle
 Voice across the miles
 Floated in the air and there you were
 当时一个气息挡了你的柔和
 从远处传来了一个声音
 在空中炰着而你就在那里



To mesmerize me
 Haunt me with its beauty
 为了吸引我
 用那美貌来找我



Wrap me in the warm embrace
 Of love so real and pure
 把握保卫在那温和的拥抱
 有着爱而如此真实与纯洁



 Love like heaven’s melody
 From which there is no cure
 Love’s the agony I can endure
 那爱如天堂的旋律
 从那没有医治
 爱是那我能忍耐的痛苦



Can I trust this feeling
 Am I merely dreaming
 我能够相信这个感受吗
 我是否只是在梦乡
 



Are these words just compliments
 Or are they words of love
 这些话是否只是一些称赞
 还是爱的言语



If there’s truth behind them
 Then the honesty’s enough
 如果在它们背后有真实
 那里面的诚实便足够



I’ve been waiting years
 Now here you are
 No longer hoping
 我等待了好多年，现在你就在这里
 不再盼望



Born again from knowing 
 That’s there’s someone in my life
 从认识中里从生
 在我生命有一件东西



Who feels the way I do
 Somebody I know I’ll be
 谁能明白我做事的方式
 我知道我会成为一个人



The special one to whom
 I will be declaring I love You
 那特别的一个
 我会宣告我爱你



No, I never knew
 Love could be so true
 不，我从不知道
 爱是那么的真实



Title: Love Song

I've heard it said that
 A man would climb a mountain
 Just to be with the one he loves
 How many times has
 He broken that promise
 



It has never been done
 I've never climbed 
 The highest mountain
 But I walked the hill of Calvary



CHORUS:
 Just to be with you
 I'd do anything
 There's no price I would not pay
 Just to be with you
 I'd give anything
 I would give my life away



 I've heard it said that
 A man would swim the ocean
 Just to be with the one he loves
 How many times has
 He broken that promise



 It can never been done
 I've never swam the deepest ocean
 But I walked upon the raging sea
 



 BRIDGE:
 I know that you don't understand
 The fullness of My love
 How I died upon the Cross 
 For your sins



And I know that you don't realise
 How much that I gave you
 But I promise
 I would do it all again
 



Just to be with you
 I've done everything
 There's no price I did not pay
 Just to be with you
 I gave everything
 Yes, I gave my life away



Title: Love Song (Who Compares To Your Beauty)

Who compares to Your beauty? 
 Who else holds all of the splendor? 
 Who else knows all the mysteries? 
 Jesus! The King of heaven 



 Let my life be a love song 
 A never-ending love song 



 I love You, everything about You 
 I love You, everything about You    
 I'm overtaken by Your love    
 It's wonderful! It's wonderful! 



 Desires overtake me for You 
 Desires overtake me for You


Title: Love Song For A Saviour

In open field of wild flowers
 She breathes the air and flies away
 She thanked her Jesus for
 The daises and the roses



 In no simple language
 Some day she'll understand
 The meaning of it all



He is more than the laughter 
 Or the stars in the heavens
 As close as a heartbeat 
 Or a song on her lips
 



 Someday she will trust Him
 And learn how to see Him
 Someday He'll call her
 And she will come running
 Fall in His arms
 The tears will fall down and she'll pray



I want to fall in love with You
 I want to fall in love with You
 I want to fall in love with You
 I want to fall in love with You
 



Sitting silent, wearing Sunday best
 The sermon echoes through the walls
 A great salvation through it
 Calls to the people who stares into nowhere
 And can't feel the chains on their souls



It seems easy to call You "Saviour"
 Not close enough to call You "God"
 So as I sit and think of
 Words I can mention
 To show my devotion



Title: Love To Praise

Your name is deep in my heart
 Famous throughout all the earth
 I'm living in Your goodness
 I'm living in Your love



Your hand is on my life
 You shelter me morning and night
 I'm living in Your blessing
 I'm living in Your favour
 



 CHORUS:
 And now, there's joy in my life
 How I love to praise
 How awesome is Your name



How I love to praise
 And honour You
 How I love to praise



How we love to praise
 Our awesome God

 He took a crown of thorns




 CHORUS:
 Oh that rugged cross my salvation
 Where Your love poured out over me
 Now my soul cries out Hallelujah
 Praise and honour unto Thee




 Sent of heaven God's own Son
 To purchase and redeem
 And reconcile the very ones
 Who nailed Him to that tree

 Now my debt is paid
 It is paid in full
 By the precious blood
 That my Jesus spilled

 Has no hold on me
 Whom the Son sets free
 Oh is free indeed

 Behold the empty tomb
 Hallelujah God be praised
 He's risen from the grave

 And man will live forever more 
 Because of Christmas Day

 That man will live forevermore 
 Because of Christmas day



While shepherds watch their flock by night
 They see a bright new shining star
 Then hear a choir sing
 The music seemed to come from afar



Now Joseph and his wife, Mary 
 Come to Bethlehem that night
 They find no place to bear the child
 Not a single room was in sight
 



 By and by, they find a little nook 
 In a stable all forlorn
 And in a manger cold and dark
 Mary's little boy was born

Title: Nail-Pierced Hands

As He trudged the road to Calvary
 His back
 It bore the Cross
 His flesh
 It bore each whip of pain



As each nail was
 Pierced into His hands
 They bled with love and life
 For a people
 Who had Him crucified



 PRE-CHORUS:
 Still He died for
 This wretched soul such as I
 Took upon the pain
 That should be mine



CHORUS:
 Who can compare to His love
 And what can compare
 To amazing grace



 That He gave His life for me
 That He opened up
 My eyes to see



His hands were nailed
 To the Cross
 And only these hands
 Can heal my broken soul



 Have you ever such a friend
 Have you held
 His nail-pierced hands



Come and let Him be your friend
 Come and hold
 His nail-pierced hands



 The Son of God
 Who wore the crown of kings
 Was willing to wear a crown
 Of sharp and painful thorns for me



 I will never fully understand
 That the hand
 That formed and shaped the seas
 Would be nailed onto a tree

 Till my raptured soul shall find
 Rest beyond the river

 Love and mercy found me
 There, the bright and morning star
 Sheds its beams around me
 



 Near the Cross, O Lamb of God
 Bring its scenes before me
 Help me walk from day to day
 With its shadows over me
 



Near the Cross, I'll watch and wait
 Hoping, trusting ever
 Till I reach the golden strand
 Just beyond the river

 十架上明亮晨星,  发亮光环绕我 



 近十架，神圣洁羔羊,  助我常思想你,  
 使我每日走天路,  十字架常荫庇 



我愿意别无所夸,  但夸救主十架 
 世界对我已钉死,  我以死对待它

 From the dung hill
 The beggars
 From the dust
 Make them sit down
 With kings and prince



 What a breakthrough in life
 God can turn all your barrenness
 Into total fruitfulness, yea
 Don't you ever give up



When man says
 It's impossible

 Don't look through your eyes of flesh
 But see by your faith



God will do a miracle
 In the midst of hopelessness, yea
 Don't you ever give up

Jesus to You I'll raise a sound

Of faith and praise

Selling all my crowns

I'm set on You, not turning away
I'll run this race

Sold out for You Lord
I'm laying down my all

All for Jesus Christ
I'm chasing after You

Laying down my cause
I'll take up the Cross

And I'll follow You
I will follow You

Cause there's no other way
But to give my life and find it

In You, in You

 My life redeemed with perfect blood
 My worth is priceless in Your heart

So I'll set my footsteps in Your path
 I'll declare that You are more than enough

You're all I need

 Jesus You are the only One

 Each new day again 
 I'll choose




 There is no one else for me
 None but Jesus
 Crucified to set me free
 Now I live to bring Him praise
  



 In the chaos
 In confusion 
 I know You're sovereign still

 In the moment of my weakness
 You give me grace to do Your will

When You call 
 I won't delay
 This my song 
 Through all my days



 All my delight is in You, Lord
 All of my hope
 All of my strength


All my delight is in You, Lord
 Forevermore

Offer Him incense, gold, and myrrh;

We to the Christ Child bring our hearts' oblations.

We would embrace Thee, with love and awe;

O holy night
The stars are brightly shining

It is the night 
Of the dear Saviour's birth

Long lay the world 
In sin and error pining

Till He appeared 
And the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope
The weary soul rejoices

For yonder breaks 
A new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices

O night divine
O night when Christ was born

O night, O holy night
O night divine

Led by the light
Of faith serenely beaming

With glowing hearts 
By His cradle we stand

So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming

Here came the wise men from Orient land

The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger

In all our trials born to be our friend

Truly He taught us to love one another

His law is love and His Gospel is peace

Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother

And in His Name all oppression shall cease

Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we

Let all within us praise His holy Name

A thrill of hope,
The weary world rejoices
困倦心灵 
得希望何其欢欣

A new and cloudless morn

O little town of Bethlehem
 How still we see Thee lie
 Above thy deep and dreamless
 Sleep the silent stars go by



Yet in Thy dark streets shineth
 The everlasting light
 The hopes and fears of all the years
 Are met in Thee tonight

 And gathered all above
 While mortals sleep
 The angels keep their watch
 Of wandering love
 O morning stars

 And praises sing to God, the King
 And peace to men on earth

 Where meek souls
 Will receive Him still
 The dear Christ enters in

Title: O worship the King

O worship the King, all glorious above,

O gratefully sing His power and His love;

Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,

Pavilioned in splendor, and girded with praise.

O tell of His might, O sing of His grace,

Whose robe is the light, whose canopy space,

His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,

And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.

The earth with its store of wonders untold,

Almighty, Thy power hath founded of old;

Established it fast by a changeless decree,

And round it hath cast, like a mantle, the sea.

Thy bountiful care, what tongue can recite?

It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;

It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,

And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.

Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,

In Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail;

Thy mercies how tender, how firm to the end,

Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend.

O measureless might! Ineffable love!

While angels delight to worship Thee above,

The humbler creation, though feeble their lays,

With true adoration shall all sing Thy praise.

 In oceans deep
 My faith will stand


Your grace abounds in 
deepest waters



 Your sovereign hand
 Will be my guide


Where feet may fail 
and fear surrounds me



 You've never failed and You won't start now


And I will call upon Your name
 And keep my eyes above the waves



 When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace
 




 
 For I am Yours and You are mine


 Spirit lead me where 
my trust is without borders



 Let me walk upon the waters
 Wherever You would call me




Take me deeper 
than my feet could ever wander



 And my faith will be made stronger
 In the presence of my Savior


Oh, Jesus, you're my God!

 To the work of Your hand


 CHORUS:
 Oceans will part
 Nations come
 At the whisper of Your call



Hope will rise
 Glory shown
 In my life 
 Your will be done

 To the work of Your hand

 I'll delight in Your ways

 To the work of Your hand

Title: Oh I Want To Know You

Just the time I feel
 That I've been caught
 In the mire of self
 Just the time I feel
 My mind's been bought
 By worldly wealth



That's when the wind
 Begins to blow
 I know the Spirit's call
 And all the worldly wonderings
 Just melt into His love
 



When my daily deeds ordinarily
 Lose life and song
 My heart begins to bleed
 Sensitivity to Him is gone
 



I've run the race
 But set the pace
 And face a shattered soul
 But the gentle arms of Jesus
 Warm my hungering to be whole



 CHORUS:
 Oh I want to know You more
 Deep within my heart
 I want to know You
 Lord, I want to know You



To feel Your heart
 And know Your mind
 Looking in Your eyes
 Stirs up within me
 Cries that say



 I want to know You
 Oh I want to know You more
 Oh I want to know You more



Title: On And On

My hope is found in nothing less
 But in Your love and righteousness
 Yours is the love that will never end
 It goes on and on and on



On and on and on and on
 On and on and on
 Yours is the love that will never end
 It goes on and on and on
 



 I dare not trust the sweetest frame
 But wholly lean on Jesus' name
 Yours is the love that defeats all shame
 It goes on and on and on



On and on and on and on
 On and on and on
 Yours is the love that defeats all shame
 It goes on and on and on

 But in His love and righteousness
 His is the love that will never end
 It goers on and on and on



On and on and on and on
 On and on and on
 His is the love that will never end
 It goes on and on and on



You'll find the comfort of Calvary
 That's where His life was slain for you
 Where mercy triumphs for eternity
 It goes on and on and on

 As I pledge my love anew
 I worship You in spirit
 I worship You in truth
 Make my life a holy praise unto You


Title: ON CHRIST THE SOLID ROCK I STAND

My hope is built on nothing less
 Than Jesus' blood and righteousness

 I dare not trust the sweetest frame
 But wholly lean on Jesus' name

On Christ the solid rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand

All other ground is sinking sand

When darkness veils His lovely face
 I rest on His unchanging grace

 In every high and stormy gale
 My anchor holds within the veil

 His oath, His covenant, His blood
 Support me in the whelming flood

 When all around my soul gives way
 He then is all my hope and stay

 When He shall come with trumpet sound
 Oh, may I then in Him be found

 Dressed in His righteousness alone
 Faultless to stand before the throne

Title: On My Lips

Title: Once Again

Jesus Christ
I think upon Your sacrifice

You became nothing
Poured out to death

Many a times
I've wondered at Your gift of life

And I'm in that place once again
I'm in that place once again

And once again
I look upon the Cross where You died

I'm humbled by Your mercy
And I'm broken inside

Once again I thank You
 Once again I pour out my life

Now You are
 Exalted to the highest place

 King of the heavens
 Where one day I'll bow

But for now
I marvel at Your saving grace

And I'm full of praise once again
I'm full of praise once again

Thank You for the Cross
Thank You for the Cross

Thank You for the Cross, my Friend

 Five little stones he took

 Went in the sling

 Round and round

 And round and round
 Then one little stone
 Went up, up, up
 And the giant came tumbling down

 The water of life
 The blood of the vine

 Everything I have means nothing



 Jesus if You're not my one thing
 Everything I need right now
 All I need is You right now

 Everything You are and nothing



Jesus if You're not my one thing
 Everything to me right now



 Just one thing I ask 
 And this I will seek
 If only to know You 




 To be where You are 
 And go where you lead
 My God I will follow




The things of this world
 I've counted as loss
 I lay it all down 
 To take up this cross

 Whoa whoa
 I want nothing but to know You 
 And to be with You my God 



 And I'll sing
 Whoa whoa
 And with everything within me
 I will worship You my God

 It overwhelms and satisfies my soul
 And I never ever have to be afraid

 The power of Your great love

 My heart from Your great love

 At the river I stand,
 Guide my feet, hold my hand:

Is your burden heavy
 As you bear it all alone
 Does the road you travel
 Harbour danger yet unknown
 



 Are you growing weary
 In the struggle of it all
 Jesus will help you
 When on His name you call
 



CHORUS:
 He is always there
 Hearing every prayer
 Faithful and true
 Walking by our side



In His love we hide
 All the day through
 When you get discouraged
 Just remember what to do
 Reach out to Jesus
 He's reaching out to you



 Is the life you're living
 Filled with sorrow and despair
 Does the future press you
 With it's worry and it's care
 



Are you tired and friendless
 Have you almost lost your way
 Jesus will help you
 Just come to Him today

 And set my feet on solid ground
 All of my days belong to You



And I breathe in 
 Your breath of life that fills my heart
 You are my all consuming fire

 And I stand here before You
 In wide-opened wonder
 Amazed at the glory of You



The power of heaven
 Revealing Your purpose in me
 As I'm reaching for You

You lift me above my fears
 And set my feet on solid ground
 All of my days belong to You
 你挪去我所有惧怕
 让我心不再失落
 一生年日都属于你



 And I breathe in 
 Your breath of life that fills my heart
 You are my all consuming fire
 你的生命气息
 充满着我的灵
 你的火焰燃烧我心

 In wide-opened wonder
 Amazed at the glory of You
 我佇立你座前
 仰望你的荣耀

 As I'm reaching for You
 我一生的意义
 展开在我面前
 耶稣 当我触摸到祢

 Lifting my hands to praise You
 Lifting my voice to thank You

 Who spoke the light upon my darkness
 You opened up my eyes so I could see




Jesus You have promised to 
 Complete the work you started
 Faithful to fulfill Your grace in me

 Fill me till I overflow
 Lord I want more

 Pull me closer than ever before
 Lord I want more

You have been so, so good to me
Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind to me

Oh, the overwhelming, never ending
Reckless love of God

Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found
Leaves the ninety-nine

I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it
Still, You give Yourself away 

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending
Reckless love of God

 When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
You have been so, so good to me
When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
You have been so, so kind to me

There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me

 You're always there to rescue me

 That I have got it figured out
 You open my eyes
 And let me see that there's no doubt

Title: Rock of Ages

Rock of Ages, cleft for me,

Let me hide myself in Thee;

Let the water and the blood,

From Thy wounded side which flowed,

Be of sin the double cure;

Save from wrath and make me pure.

Not the labor of my hands

Can fulfill Thy law's demands;

Could my zeal no respite know,

Could my tears forever flow,

All for sin could not atone;

Thou must save, and Thou alone.

Nothing in my hand I bring,

Simply to the cross I cling;

Naked, come to Thee for dress;

Helpless look to Thee for grace;

Foul, I to the fountain fly;

Wash me, Savior, or I die.

While I draw this fleeting breath,

When mine eyes shall close in death,

[originally When my eye-strings break in death]

When I soar to worlds unknown,

See Thee on Thy judgment throne,

Rock of Ages, cleft for me,

Let me hide myself in Thee.

 Here on this altar, Father
 I lay all my dreams
 And offer back to You
 This child You've given me



Oh son, you must believe
 He's called us to obey
 And by His love 
 He'll make a better way



Oh Abraham, Oh Abraham
 Now that I know 
 You fear My name
 Withold your hand



Oh Abraham, Oh faithful man
 Your only son
 He's not the one
 Behold the ram
 Behold the lamb
 



 It must had been the hardest thing
 He's ever done
 When God, the Father 
 Sacrificed His only Son


 The One that He most cherished 
 Gave His life away
 And by His love He made a better way



 And so I cherish You
 And so I honour You
 For truly You're the 
 Giver of all good things
 



And so I cherish You
 And so I honour You
 Your sacrifice is now 
 The King of kings



 Jehovah Jireh, He has provided
 The sacrifice of love 
 No man could ever pay
 And what He requires from you and me



Even the hardest thing
 Your blood, Oh Chirst
 Your sacrifice gives me strength to obey

 Calling, O sinner, come home!

 Pleading for you and for me?
 Why should we linger and heed not His mercies
 Mercies for you and for me?



Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing
 Passing from you and from me;
 Shadows are gathering, death-beds are coming
 Coming for you and for me!

 Pardon for you and for me!

 And be Your hands and feet

 Your love is all we need

 Our Savior and our King

His banner we wave

Title: Somewhere In The Middle

 Somewhere between the hot 
 And the cold
 Somewhere between the new 
 And the old



 Somewhere between who I am 
 And who I used to be
 Somewhere in the middle
 You'll find me



Somewhere between the wrong 
 And the right
 Somewhere between the darkness 
 And the light



Somewhere between who I was 
 And who You're making me
 Somewhere in the middle
 You'll find me



Just how close can I get, Lord
 To my surrender 
 Without losing all control



Fearless warriors in a picket fence
 Reckless abandon 
 Wrapped in common sense
 Deep water faith 
 In the shallow end and
 We are caught in the middle



 With eyes wide open 
 To the differences
 The God we want and the God who is
 But will we trade our dreams or His
 Or are we caught in the middle



 Somewhere between my heart 
 And my hands
 Somewhere between my faith 
 And my plans



 Somewhere between the 
 Safety of the boat
 And the crashing waves
 



Somewhere between a whisper 
 And a roar
 Somewhere between the altar 
 And the door



Somewhere between 
 Contented peace
 And always wanting more
 Somewhere in the middle
 You'll find me



Just how close can I get, Lord
 To my surrender 
 Without losing all control



Lord, I feel You in this place and
 I know You're by my side
 Loving me even on these nights when
 I'm caught in the middle


Title: Son Of God

 Hold my hand and walk with me
 You're the light that makes me see
 On this path 
 My soul You, lead
 O my Shepherd, walk with me

 You're my hope 
 In You I live
 Angles worship at Your throne
 Power and glory to You alone



 CHORUS:
 My Saviour
 Glorious One
 My Redeemer
 Living in my heart



 Now and forever
 Your kingdom come
 Jesus, Son of God
 Jesus, Son of God



Jesus, O Jesus
 Holy is the Lamb of God
 Jesus, O Jesus
 Worthy is the Lamb of  God

She'll give birth to Him shortly
 Though she's been with no man
 He'll be King of the world for good
 And that's His Father's plan
 



So we should start to praise
 And shouldn't be shy!
 The child is the Lord
 And that's no small fry
 



The Son of God is coming to town!
 The Son of God is coming to town!
 The Son of God is coming to town!

Title: SPOKEN 1

“This child is destined to cause many in Israel to fall, 
and many others to rise.

As a result, the deepest thoughts 
of many hearts will be revealed. 

And a sword will pierce your very soul.” 

Title: Stand In The Gap

 On behalf of their nation

 CHORUS:
 We'll stand in the gap
 On behalf of our land
 We'll stand in the gap
 On behalf of our land

 We'll take our stand
 And there intercede for our land
 We'll pray for the needs of our land



The powers of darkness
 Released on our lands
 Will never prevail
 Will never withstand



The deep intercession
 By a people of passion
 Those who will rise up and pray

When sorrow comes to steal the joy I own

I am not a captive to the lies

I’m not afraid to leave my past behind
I won’t be shaken, I won’t be shaken

My fear doesn’t stand a chance 
When I stand in Your love

 There’s power that can break off every chain
There’s power that can empty out a grave

There’s resurrection power that can save
There’s power in Your name

 A crown of life shall be

 You're brighter than the morning star
 



You're fairer
 Much fairer than the lily
 That grows by the wayside
 You're precious
 More precious than gold
 



Title: Sweet wind

There's a wind a blowing
 All across the land
 A fragrant breeze of heaven
 Blowing once again



 Don't know where it comes from
 Don't know where it goes
 But let it blow over me
 Oh, sweet wind
 Come and blow over me




 There's a rain a pouring
 Showers from above
 Mercy drops are coming
 Mercy drops of love




 Turn your face to heaven
 Let the water pour
 Well, let it pour over me
 Oh, sweet rain
 Come and pour over me
 



 There's a fire burning
 Falling from the sky
 Awesome tongues of fire
 Consuming you and I



Can you feel it burning
 Burn the sacrifice
 Well, let it burn over me
 Oh, sweet fire
 Come and burn over me



Title: Swing Low, Sweet Chariot

Swing low, sweet chariot,

Coming for to carry me home,

Swing low, sweet chariot,

Coming for to carry me home.

I looked over Jordan, and what did I see?

Coming for to carry me home,

A band of angels coming after me,

Coming for to carry me home.

If you get there before I do,

Coming for to carry me home,

Tell all my friends I'm coming, too.

Coming for to carry me home.

I'm sometimes up and sometimes down,

Coming for to carry me home,

But still my soul feels heavenly bound,

Coming for to carry me home.

The brightest day that I can say,

Coming for to carry me home,

When Jesus washed my sins away,

Coming for to carry me home.

 Following the shining light

 In Your hands
 The power to save the world
 My life

Take me pass the outer courts 
 And through the holy place

 Pass the brazen altar
 Lord, I long to see Your face

Pass me by the crowds of people
 And the priests who sing their praise

 I hunger and thirst for Your righteousness
 But it's only found one place

 So take me in to the holy of holies
 Take me in by the blood of the Lamb

 So take me in to the holy of holies

Take the coal, cleanse my lips 
 Here I am

Bring me in the Inner Court
 And past the Golden Light

 And through the Incense Altar
 Lord I long to see Your light

Title: TAKE MY HEALING TO THE NATIONS

I hear a young child crying
 And see tears of unending pain
 I've watched as war torn nations
 Treated life with such disdain


My heart grieves to know that
 These haven't come to understand
 That I suffered for their suffering
 And died that they might live



CHORUS:
 Take My healing to the nations
 Bind their broken hearts with love
 Stretch My hand throughout creation
 With this message of My love



That I came to bring light in their darkness
 And bring joy where there once was pain
 Take My healing to the nations
 Bind their broken hearts with love



For the love fields they're ready for harvest
 And the labourers they're so few
 Countless millions still that I want to fill
 But the task isn't Mine to do


I gave you My commandment
 Go and preach good tidings of love
 For I finish the work on Calvary
 And their healing already been done


Title: TAKE MY LIFE

How many times have I turned away
 The number is the same
 As the sand on the shore
 But every time You've taken me back
 And now I pray You do it once more



CHORUS:
 Please take from me my life
 When I don't have the strength
 To give it away to You
 



Please take from me my life
 When I don't have the strength
 To give it away to You, Jesus



How many times have I turned away
 The number is the same
 As the stars in the sky
 But every time You've taken me back
 And now I pray You do it once more



Title: TAKE MY LIFE AND LET IT BE

 Take my life and let it be
 Consecrated, Lord, to Thee
 Take my hands and let them move
 At the impulse of Thy love



 Take my feet and let them be
 Swift and beautiful for Thee
 Take my voice and let me sing
 Always, only for my King



Take my lips and let them be
 Filled with messages from Thee
 Take my silver and my gold
 Not a mite would I withhold



Take my moments and my days
 Let them flow in endless praise
 Take my intellect and use
 Every pow’r as Thou shalt choose



Take my will and make it Thine
 It shall be no longer mine
 Take my heart, it is Thine own
 It shall be Thy royal throne



Take my love, my Lord, I pour
 At Thy feet its treasure store
 Take myself and I will be
 Ever, only, all for Thee

Title: THANK YOU (FOR GIVING TO THE LORD)

 I dreamed I went to heaven
 And You were there with me
 We walked upon the streets of gold
 Beside the crystal sea
 



We heard the angels singing
 Then someone called Your name
 You turned and saw this young man
 And he was smiling as he came
 



 He said,
 "Friend, you may not know me now"
 And then He said "But wait"
 You used to teach my Sunday school
 When I was only eight



And every week you would say a prayer
 Before the class began
 And one day, when you said that prayer
 I asked Jesus in my heart



Thank you for giving to the Lord
 I am a life that was changed
 Thank you for giving to the Lord
 I am so glad you gave



Then another man stood before you
 And said remember the time
 A missionary came to your church
 And his pictures made you cry
 



 You didn't have much money
 But you gave it anyway
 Jesus took the gift you gave
 And that's why I'm here today
 



One by one they came
 Far as the eye could see
 Each life somehow touched
 By your generosity
 



Little things that you have done
 Sacrifices made
 Unnoticed on the earth
 In heaven now proclaimed
 



And I know up in heaven
 You're not supposed to cry
 But I am almost sure
 There were tears in your eyes



As Jesus took your hand
 And you stood before the Lord
 He said, " My child, look around you
 Great is your reward


Title: THANK YOU (FOR THE BLOOD OF JESUS)

 You've given me peace like a river
 And Your love has flooded my soul
 When I think of all You've done for me
 There is nothing I can offer but everything

 All You had
 You gave for me
 There is nothing I can offer but everything

Title: THANK YOU LORD (FOR THE TRIALS)

Thank You, Lord
 For the trials that come my way

In the way I can grow each day
As I let You lead

And I thank You, Lord
For the patience those trials bring

In that process of growing up
I can learn to care

But it goes against the way I am
 To put my human nature down

And let the Spirit
Take control of all I do

Because when those trials come
My human nature shouts, the thing to do

And God's soft prompting
Can be easily ignored

But I thank You, Lord
With each trial I feel inside

That You're there to help, lead and guide
Me away from wrong

Cause You've promised, Lord
That with every testing

That Your way of escaping's
Easier to bear

Yes, I thank You, Lord
For the victory that growing brings

In surrender of everything
Life is so worthwhile

And I thank You, Lord
That when everything’s put in place

Out in from I can see Your face
And it's there You belong

Title: THANK YOU LORD FOR THE HOLY GHOST

Title: THAT YOU WOULD REND

 Within my heart hidden in the dark
 Shattered dreams and broken parts
 I find that I am stranded by
 All of this darkness deep inside



I've tried so hard 
 Searched many times
 Hoping to heal this heart of mine
 But still I'm lost, so powerless
 I'm crying out for something real



PRE-CHORUS:
 A rumour, a whisper of things long ago
 Of Your great and awesome deeds
 As I reach out to heaven
 My heart wanting more
 Renew them in my life today



CHORUS:
 That You would rend the heavens and come down
 This is my cry
 That the heavens will shake
 And the nations will quake
 In the presence of an awesome God
 



That You would send Your mighty hand
 All I want is more of You in my life
 As You rend the heavens 
 I will live again


 I'm standing here before You, Lord
 As I wait, You will restore
 My heart is set, never turning back
 Lord, won't You have Your way in me
 



All I want is to be with You
 That is where my heart belongs
 Down at Your feet, I lift my heart
 All of my life, in every part
 



BRIDGE:
 As I humble myself
 Pray and seek Your face
 As I lay down my pride
 Turn from my wicked ways
 Hear from heaven
 Heal my land


Title: THAT YOU WOULD REND (2L)

Within my heart hidden in the dark
Shattered dreams and broken parts

I find that I am stranded by
All of this darkness deep inside

I've tried so hard, searched many times
Hoping to heal this heart of mine

But still I'm lost, so powerless
I'm crying out for something real

A rumour, a whisper of things long ago
Of Your great and awesome deeds

As I reach out to heaven
My heart wanting more

Renew them in my life today

That You would rend the heavens and come down
This is my cry

The heavens will shake, the nations will quake
In the presence of an awesome God

That You would send Your mighty hand
All I want is more of You in my life

As You rend the heavens 
I will live again

I'm standing here before You, Lord
As I wait, You will restore

My heart is set, never turning back
Lord, won't You have Your way in me

All I want is to be with You
That is where my heart belongs

Down at Your feet, I lift my heart
All of my life, in every part

As I humble myself, pray and seek Your face
As I lay down my pride, turn from my wicked ways

Hear from heaven
Heal my land

Title: THAT'S THE LOVE OF GOD

What made God take so much care
 To make creation grow
 He could have made it black and white
 And we have never known
 And what made God send Jesus
 To die on Calvary
 Of course it was this joyous thing
 I feel inside of me



That's the love of God/ It's never ending
 That's the love of God/ Always forgiving
 He's always there, He never fails
 All He will do is love forever
 And He loves to share it
 That's the love of God



It can change a family
 It already changed the world
 When Jesus
 Brings it to our hearts
 Heaven's banner is unfurled
 And once you start to share it
 In His precious name
 You're glad to see your view of life
 Will never be the same


Title: THAT'S WHAT FAITH CAN DO

 Everybody falls sometimes
 Got to find the strength to rise
 From the ashes
 And make a new beginning
 



 Anyone can feel the ache
 You think its more than you can take
 But you're stronger
 Stronger than you know



 Don't you give up now
 The sun will soon be shining
 You got to face the clouds 
 To find the silver lining



I see dreams that move the mountains 
 Hope that doesn't ever end
 Even when the sky is falling



I see miracles just happen
 Silent prayers get answered
 Broken hearts become brand new
 That's what faith can do



I see miracles just happen
 Silent prayers get answered
 Broken hearts become brand new
 That's what faith can do



 Everybody's scared to death
 When we try to take that step
 Out on the water
 It will be alright


Life is so much more
 Than what your eyes are seeing
 You will find your way
 If you keep believing
 



 BRIDGE:
 Overcome the odds
 You don't have chance
 When the world says you can't 
 I'll tell you that you can


Even when you fall sometimes
 You will find the strength to rise

Title: The Cause Of Christ

The only thing
I want in life

Is to be known
For loving Christ

To build his church
To love his bride

And make His name
Known far and wide

For this cause I live
For this cause I'd die

I surrender all
For the cause of Christ

All I once held dear
I will leave behind

For my joy is this
Oh, the cause of Christ

He is all my soul will prize
Regardless of the joy or trial

When agonizing questions rise
In Jesus all my hope abides

Jesus, my Jesus
For your glory For your name

Jesus, my Jesus
I will only sing your praise

It is not fame
That I desire

Nor stature
In my brother's eye

I pray it's said
About my life

That I lived more to build
Your name than mine

 The idols of men are all falling

 We reign forever and ever
 He's given us power and authority
 When they shout
 The strongholds
 Of satan come crashing down

 May I walk with You by faith and not by sight

 让我凭信心而不凭眼见

 I have nothing but to offer You my life
 在你的宝座前降服
 我献上我的生命

 你的怜悯解除我的忧虑




Open hearted 
 I will search and I will find
 我敞开我的心寻找

 I stand for everything that's true
 谦卑的王你在我之前
 我站立在你的恩典



 Through Your Son I am made worthy
 There's no other who can love me like You do
 通过圣子我配得
 没有人比你更爱我



 And forever 
 I keep running back to You
 我投向你的怀抱




You reign
 You reign in all the earth


Title: THE FIRST NOEL

The first Noel
 The angel did say
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
 



 In fields where they lay 
 Keeping their sheeps
 On a cold winter's night 
 That was so deep



CHORUS:
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
 Born is the King of Israel
 



 They looked up and saw a star
 Shining in the east, beyond them far
 And to the earth it gave great light
 And so it continued both day and night


And by the light of that same star
 Three wise men came from country far
 To seek for a King was their intent
 And to follow the star wherever it went
 



This star drew nigh to the north-west
 O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
 And there it did both stop and stay
 Right over the place where Jesus lay
 



Then entered in those three wise men
 Fall reverently upon the knees
 And offered there, in His presence
 Their gold, and myrrh and frankincense



Title: THE FREEDOM WE KNOW

The world turns in all of its ways
 But I'm soul set on a holy Name

 And when all the earth is said and done
 Still I'll praise Him





There's no end to the love that He gives
 And now broken dream have life again

In the hope of a risen King
 Let us praise Him

 A mystery unthinkable that He took the fall
 Just to save my soul

 Now to love is the life I know
 On and on and on we'll be singin'


 Soul set free in the One I love
 Oh come on, come on

 And let the whole earth sing
 In the freedom we know

 Come on, come on
 And praise him

Come, come all the lost and found
 Let us rise up with a holy sound

 All the earth unified as one
 Just to praise Him

 In full view with nothing to hide
 Like a city on a hill

 We're gonna shine in the light of Your freedom
 Let us praise Him

We're gonna dance dance dance
 In the freedom we know

 We're gonna dance dance
in the freedom we know


 Because the freedom we know
 Is gonna last forever

Title: THE GATES OF HELL SHALL NOT PREVAIL

The gates of hell shall not prevail
 Against the army of the Lord
 We will march onward
 To sing a song
 To the One who sets us free



We will use God's word
 Like a two-edged sword
 Against the enemy



CHORUS:
 Emmanuel
 We're marching in Your name
 Emmanuel
 The Lamb that was slain


Emmanuel
 He's risen again
 Emmanuel (3x)
 He is Lord

Title: THE GREAT ESCAPE

My Jesus is born
My little dear boy

So sweet and so pure
Are you really the One

Sent from heaven above
To show forth God's love

To a broken world
To save all our souls

Come! Come!
Have you heard the rumours?

 Mary has given birth to a son!

And the three wise men said that 
He is the Messiah

The One who will save us all! 

Have you heard the rumours of a boy
Conceived of a virgin's womb

As a tender shoot He'll grow
In wisdom and power

He's the promised Messiah
He will free us from terror

Yes He's coming to save us
He's coming for sure!

Silence!
I’ll tail him down and crush Him with my hands

No king shall threaten my rule
I’ll kill every one who stands in my way!

See the blood stained fields
Smell the scent of fear

Our time is drawing near
Though we're innocent people

I feel the burning fire
I hear the cries in the night

Does anyone even care
That we're innocent people

30 YEARS LATER

These years have passed so quickly
Now You're here beside me

His word has never failed
My dream is fulfilled

In time to come I know
A sword will pierce my soul

When You take upon yourself
The weight of the world

The Lord has given a land of good things
I will press in and make them mine

And in His kingdom I will shine

With the high praises of God in our mouth
And a two-edged sword in our hand

We'll march right on to the victory side
Right into Canaan's land

Gird up your armour, ye sons of Zion
Gird up your armour, let's go to war

We'll win the battle with great rejoicing
And so we'll praise Him more and more

We'll bind their kings in chains and fetters
We'll bind their nobles tight in iron

To execute God's written judgement
March on to glory, sons of Zion!

Title: The Old Rugged Cross

On a hill far away
 Stood an old rugged Cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
 And I love that old Cross

 Where the dearest and best
 For the world of lost sinners was slain



 So I'll cherish the old rugged Cross
 Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged Cross
 And exchange it someday for a crown

 O that old rugged Cross
 So despised by the world
 Has a wondrous attraction for me

For the dear Lamb of God
 Left His glory above  
To bear it to dark Calvary

In that old rugged Cross
 Stained with blood so divine
A wondrous beauty I see
 For t'was on that old Cross

Jesus suffered and died
 To pardon and sanctify me

To the old rugged Cross
 I will ever be true
Its shame and reproach gladly bear
 Then He'll call me someday

To my home far away
 Where His glory forever I'll share

Title: The Only Hope

There is much confusion
 In the world today
 Peace is turn to fighting
 And love is turn to hate



 This is not what God intended
 This is not what He had planned
 Things were very different now
 Than when we first began



We say God is our Father
 We say we trust in Him
 We have left His ways for our ways
 And fallen into sin



 Yet we claim to seek forgiveness
 And we say we'll follow Him
 But God would not have led us
 To this place where we now live



 The only hope for the world is Jesus
 The only help for the earth is a touch from God
 O how we need Him, we must seek Him



 With all of our hearts
 With all of our soul
 There is no other help we know
 In Jesus Christ, the only hope for the world



O it's time for all our people
 To call upon the Lord
 And pray to God Almighty
 To touch and heal our world



That every heart will be humbled
 And each soul will turn to God
 Then love will reign in every heart
 And love would be enough



The only peace is the Prince of Peace
 Moving in our hearts today
 And the only good news
 Is the good news
 That Jesus is the way
 



We must seek Him
 There is no other help we know
 In Jesus Christ
 The only hope for the world

Title: The Power Of Your Name

 Surely children weren't made for the streets
 And fathers were not made to leave
 Surely this isn't how it should be
 Let Your kingdom come



 Surely nations were not made for war
 Or the broken meant to be ignored
 Surely this just can't be what you saw



 Let Your kingdom come
 Here in my heart



 CHORUS:
 I will live
 To carry Your compassion
 To love a world that's broken
 To be Your hands and feet
 



 I will give
 With the life that I've been given
 And go beyond religion
 To see the world be changed
 By the power of Your name



 Surely life wasn't made to regret
 And the lost were not made to forget
 Surely faith without action is dead



 BRIDGE:
 Jesus, Your name
 Is a shelter for the hurting
 Jesus, Your name
 Is a refuge for the weak



 Only Your name
 Can redeem the undeserving
 Jesus, Your name
 Holds everything I need


Title: The Promise (Thanksgiving)

The Lord God said when time was full 
 He would shine His light in the darkness 
 



 He said a virgin would conceive 
 And give birth to the Promise
 



 For a thousand years 
 The dreamers dreamt 
 And hoped to see His love 



 But the Promise 
 Showed their wildest dreams 
 



 Had simply not been wild enough 
 The Promise showed their wildest dreams 
 Had simply not been wild enough



The Promise was love 
 And the Promise was life
 The Promise meant light to the world 



 Living proof, Jehovah saves
 For the name of the Promise was Jesus
 



 The Faithful One saw time was full
 And the ancient pledge was honoured 
 So God the Son, the Incarnate One 



 His final word, His own Son
 Was born in Bethlehem
 



But came into our hearts to live
 What more could God have given 
 Tell me what more did He have to give



Title: The River

It doesn't matter
Who you are

It doesn't matter
Where you've been

It doesn't matter
What's the scar

It doesn't matter
What's the sin

It doesn't matter
How you fell

Somewhere along the way

There is healing
For your life today

There's a river that flows
From the fountain of God

And it heals every pain
Along the way

I have tasted
And known

That for every broken heart

There is healing
In Jesus' name

He looks beyond
How far you've gone

He looks beyond
When you were hurt

He looks beyond
Who stole your song

He looks beyond
What makes it worst

He looks beyond
What others say

To reach out to you
And say

There is healing
For your life today

It's a river that flows 
It's a river that lives

It's the river of life 
Living water it gives

Title: The River Is Here

 Down the mountain
 The river flows
 And it brings refreshing
 Wherever it goes
 



 Through the valleys
 And over the fields
 The river is rushing
 And the river is here
 



 CHORUS:
 The river of God 
 Sets our feet at dancing
 The river of God 
 Fills our hearts with cheer
 



 The river of God
 Fills our mouth with laughter
 And we rejoice
 For the river is here



 The river of God is
 Teeming with life
 And all who touch it
 Can be revived



 And all who linger
 On this river's shore
 Will come back thirsting
 For more of the Lord



Up to the mountain we love to go
 To find the presence of the Lord
 Along the banks of the river we run
 We dance with laughter
 Giving praise to the Son


Title: The Roar

 I waited for the Lord
 He appeared in blinding light
 He led me through the darkest night
 When I couldn’t see and my strength was failing me



 I heard the roar of the Lion of Judah
 I heard the voice that calms the raging sea
 He came to me, came to me
 When I needed the Lord
 I heard the roar of the Lion of Judah



 I lifted my hands
 He lifted me out
 All praise to the Savior, all worship to God
 With all that I am
 With all in my heart
 All praise to the Savior, all worship to God




I heard the roar of the Lion of Judah
 I heard the voice that calms the raging sea
 He came to me, came to me
 When I needed the Lord,
 I heard the roar of the Lion of Judah




 You came to me, came to me
 When I needed You, Lord
 I heard the roar of the lion of Judah
 I heard the roar of the lion of Judah


Title: The Servant King

From heaven You came, helpless babe
 Entered our world, Your glory veiled
 Not to be served but to serve
 And give Your life that we might live



 CHORUS:
 This is our God, the servant King
 He calls us now to follow Him
 To bring our lives
 As a daily offering of worship
 To the servant King
 



 There in the garden of tears
 My heavy load He chose to bear
 His heart with sorrow was torn
 'Yet not My will but Yours,' He said



Come, see His hands and His feet
 The scars that speak of sacrifice
 Hands that flung stars into space
 To cruel nails surrendered



 So let us learn how to serve Him
 And in our lives enthrone Him
 Each other's needs to prefer
 For it is Christ we're serving
 


Title: The Solid Rock

My hope is built on nothing less
 Than Jesus' blood and righteousness

 I dare not trust the sweetest frame
 But wholly lean on Jesus' name

When darkness seems to hide His face
 I rest on His unchanging grace

 In every high and stormy gale
 My anchor holds within the veil

 His oath, His covenant, His blood
 Support me in the whelming flood

 When all around my soul gives way
 He then is all my hope and stay

 When He shall come with trumpet sound
 Oh, may I then in Him be found

 Dressed in His righteousness alone
 Faultless to stand before the throne

Title: The Source Of Life

 Jehovah, Your love and compassion 
 Is as high as the skies
 Jehovah, Your faithfulness 
 Reaches the heavens



 Because they dwell in Your temple 
 Your sweet presence will satisfy them
 Because You call them 
 To drink from the river of joy



 CHORUS:
 Because You are the Source of life
 In Your glory we can see light, Hallelujah
 Because they dwell in Your temple 
 Your sweet presence will satisfy them
 Because You call them 
 To drink from the river of joy



Title: The Spirit Of The Lord Is Now Upon Me

 And set the captives free
 To open prison doors
 And make the blind to see

 Is now on me

Title: The Trees Of The Field

 You shall go out with joy
 And be led forth in peace
 The mountains and the hills
 Will break forth before you
 There'll be shouts of joy
 And all the trees of the field
 Will clap, will clap their hands



CHORUS:
 And all the trees of the field
 Will clap their hands
 The trees of the field
 Will clap their hands
 The trees of the field
 Will clap their hands

Title: The Unashamed

 I will not
 Give up, or shut up
 Or let up, or slow up, 'till I've
 Preached up, and prayed up,
 And stored up, and stayed up (2x)



 I can never be
 bought,
 compromised,
 detoured,
 lured away,
 turned back,
 deluded,
 or delayed (2x)



CHORUS:
 I must go 'till He comes
 Give 'till I drop
 Preach 'till all know
 And work 'till He stops me
 I have a growing faith that is deep down inside
 And this is the Spirit in which I abide


Title: The Vision

 I have seen the heathen in their darkness
 I have heard their cry of grim despair
 All my heart is burning with the passion
 To bring them the light of Jesus there
 



CHORUS:
 Take me, Master, break me, use me
 I am leaning on Thy breast
 All ambition fast are dying
 From their pain now give me rest
 



 On the altar I have lain them
 Now to Thee I give my heart
 Fill me with the fire of vision
 Let my passion ne'er depart



All my life I've long to catch a vision
 That would lift me to the Christ of love
 And I found it in the dying millions
 Reaching for the message from above



Ev-'ry dream and ev-'ry burning longing
 I surrender to their crying need
 I am leaving ev-'ry hope behind me
 To follow anywhere my Lord may lead



 Men may sneer and even friends deride me
 But I'll follow Jesus all the way
 He will safely lead thro' storm-tossed waters
 And dry my every tear at close of day
 
 


Title: The Walls Will Come Down

 The walls will come down
 With a shout of praise
 The walls will come down
 With a shout of joy



The walls will come down
 With a shout of triumph
 To the Lord God Almighty



With the sword of the Spirit in our hands
 The Word of God in our mouth
 With the blood of Jesus to set us free
 We have the victory


Title: The Wise Man

 The wise man built his house upon the Rock (x3)
 And the rains came tumbling down

The rain came down and the flood came up (x3) 
 And the house on the Rock stood firm

The foolish man built his house upon the sand (x3)
 And the rains came tumbling down

The rain came down and the flood came up (x3)
 And the house on the sand was smashed

 So build your life upon the Lord Jesus Christ (x3)
 And the blessings will come down

 The blessings come down and the prayers go up (x3)
 So build your life upon the Rock

 By the power of Your own blood

 Who call on the name of Jesus

 For there's nothing I can do
 Without You, Jesus

 That the world can't understand

 A driving force that
 Cannot be stopped
 A fire that cannot be quenched

Title: There Is A Fountain

There is a fountain filled with blood
 Drawn from Immanuel's vein
 And sinners plunged beneath that flood
 Lose all their guilty stains



Lose all their guilty stains
 Lose all their guilty stains
 And sinners plunged beneath that flood
 Lose all their guilty stains



 The dying thief rejoiced to see
 That fountain in his day
 And there may I, though vile as he
 Wash all my sins away



 Wash all my sins away
 Wash all my sins away
 And there may I though vile as he
 Wash all my sins away



Thou dying Lamb
 Thy precious blood
 Shall never lose its power
 Till all the ransomed church of God
 Are saved to sin no more



Are saved to sin no more
 Are saved to sin no more
 Till all the ransomed church of God
 Are saved to sin no more



 For since by faith I saw the stream
 Thy flowing wounds supply
 Redeeming love has been my theme
 And shall be till I die



And shall be till I die
 And shall be till I die
 Redeeming love has been my theme
 And shall be till I die



Then in a nobler, sweeter song
 I'll sing Thy power to save
 When this poor lisping stammering tongue
 Lies silent in the grave



 Lies silent in the grave
 Lies silent in the grave
 When this poor lisping stammering tongue
 Lies silent in the grave



Title: There Is A Hope So Sure

 There is a hope so sure
 A promise so secured
 The mystery of God
 At last made known



 Treasures so vast appeared
 All wisdoms, knowledge here
 It's Christ in us
 The hope of glory



CHORUS:
 And the life that I now live
 No longer is my own
 Jesus lives in me
 The hope of glory



 And each day I live
 No longer is my own
 Jesus lives in me
 The hope of glory



 There is a life so true
 A life of love so pure
 For all our sin
 A perfect sacrifice



 And when that life was nailed
 On cruel cross impaled
 Our sinful flesh
 With Him was crucified



 There is a life so strong
 That a whole world of wrong
 And all the powers of hell
 Could not defeat



 For Jesus rose again
 And if we died with Him
 With Him, we'll rise
 To share His endless life

Hold us, who wait before Thee
Near to the heart of God

There is a place of comfort sweet
Near to the heart of God

A place where we our Saviour meet
Near to the heart of God

There is a place of full release
Near to the heart of God

A place where all is joy and peace
Near to the heart of God

Title: There Is A River

 That never shall run dry

 What we do here is just the beginning
 New life is starting at every ending
 We are a part of the story unfolding
 This is the weight of the world we are holding
 This could be our day
 This could be our day



Clearly it's time to make a change
 Or I could keep sitting and waste all day
 I know that it's time for to move
 I've been given this minute to use
 And given this moment to prove that


 I was holding back
 Now I've come undone
 I want to touch the world
 Heal the broken ones
 Ending the cycle has just begun
 We've been given this minute to use
 And given this life to prove



To give ourselves away
 For something beautiful
 A million miles away
 To the one who's hungry, and thirsty



 And needs some hope
 To the people that are weary and
 Broken and left alone
 I'm giving myself away
 I'm giving myself away

 There at the cross upon that hill
 Lord, You fulfilled the Father’s will

The soldiers tried to
Clear the narrow street

But the crowd pressed in to see
The man condemned to die on Calvary

He was bleeding from the beating
There were stripes upon His back

And He wore a crown of thorns
Upon His head

And He bore with every step
The sins of those

Who cried out for His death
 



Down the Via Dolorosa
Called the way of suffering

Like a Lamb came
The Messiah, Christ the King

But He chose to walk that road
Out of His love for you and me

All the way to Calvary

The blood that would cleanse
The souls of all men

Made His way
To the heart of Jerusalem

 And all my love is due Him

 Beneath the cleansing blood



 I heard about His healing
 Of His cleansing power revealing
 How He made the lame to walk again
 And caused the blind to see



And then I cried,
 "Dear Jesus
 Come and heal my broken spirit"
 And somehow Jesus came and brought
 To me the victory
 



I heard about a mansion
 He has built for me in glory
 And I heard about the streets of gold
 Beyond the crystal sea
 



About the angels singing
 And the old redemption story
 And some sweet day I'll sing up there
 The song of victory

 The earth shall stand and see that

Traveler, blessedness and light, peace and truth its course portends.

Watchman, will its beams alone gild the spot that gave them birth?

Traveler, ages are its own; see, it bursts over all the earth.

Watchman, tell us of the night, for the morning seems to dawn.

Traveler, darkness takes its flight, doubt and terror are withdrawn.

Title: WE ARE THE REASON (2L)

As little children
We will dream of Christmas morn

Of all the gifts and toys
We knew we’d find

But we never realised
A baby born one blessed night

Gave us the greatest gift of our lives

We were the reason
That He gave His life

We were the reason
That He suffered and died

To a world that was lost
He gave all He could give

To show us the reason to live

As the years went by
We learned more about gifts

The giving of ourselves
And what that means

On a dark and cloudy day
A man hung crying in the rain

Because of love
Because of love

I’ve finally found the reason for living

It’s in giving every part 
Of my heart to Him

In all that I do 
Every word that I say

I’ll be giving my all 
Just for Him, for Him

Title: WE ARE THE REASON (2L) COMBINED

As little children
We will dream of Christmas morn
小的时候
我们梦想圣诞节

Of all the gifts and toys
We knew we’d find
在美丽的早晨
有玩具礼物

But we never realised
A baby born one blessed night
但我们从没想过
有个婴孩的诞生

Gave us the greatest 
gift of our lives
赐我们最伟大 
生命礼物

We were the reason
That He gave His life
祢为了我们
付出了生命

We were the reason
That He suffered and died
祢为了我们
釘死在十架上

To a world that was lost
He gave all He could give
为迷失的世人
祢付出一切

To show us the reason to live
赐我们生命真谛

As the years went by
We learned more about gifts
长大以后
我们学习更明白

The giving of ourselves
And what that means
思想我们自己是
什么意义

On a dark and cloudy day
A man hung crying in the rain
在乌云黑暗的那天
祂哭喊挂在十架

Because of love
Because of love
全都是因为爱 
为了爱

I’ve finally found 
the reason for living
我终于明白
活着的原因

It’s in giving every part 
of my heart to Him
就是把整个人
全颗心献于你

In all that I do 
every word that I say
做的一切
和说的每句话

I’ll be giving my all just for Him
for Him
我把所有一切
全献于他

Title: We Three Kings

We three kings of Orient are;

Bearing gifts we traverse afar,

Field and fountain, moor and mountain,

Following yonder star.

O star of wonder, star of light,

Star with royal beauty bright,

Westward leading, still proceeding,

Guide us to thy perfect light.

Born a King on Bethlehem's plain

Gold I bring to crown Him again,

King forever, ceasing never,

Over us all to reign.

Frankincense to offer have I;

Incense owns a Deity nigh;

Prayer and praising, voices raising,

Worshipping God on high.

Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume

Breathes a life of gathering gloom;

Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,

Sealed in the stone cold tomb.

Refrain

Glorious now behold Him arise;

King and God and sacrifice;

Alleluia, Alleluia,

Sounds through the earth and skies.

Cause He keeps our family
Growing stronger



With the heart of a child
Jesus taught us to come

When I see the beauty of
A sunset's glory



Amazing artistry across
The evening sky



When I feel the mystery of
A distant galaxy



It awes and humbles me
To be loved by a God so high



What can I do but thank You
What can I do but give my life to You
Hallelujah, Hallelujah



What can I do but praise You
Everyday make everything



I do a Hallelujah
A hallelujah, hallelujah



When I hear the story of
A God of mercy
Who shared humanity and suffered



By our side
Of the cross they nailed You to
That could not hold You



Now You're making all things new
By the power of Your risen life

Title: What If (Faith)

What if we birth forth a new desire
What if we obey as God requires

What if faith within our heart’s arise
Won’t God pour out in great delight 

 Oceans part, mountains move
Dead will rise, the empty filled

Broken hearts will be renewed
Let faith arise

What if we give room for God to speak
What if in our hearts its God we seek

What if we pray and fast to intercede
Won’t God be moved to intervene

We believe in You, We believe in You
 to move, to move

We believe in You, we believe in You
won’t You move, won’t You move

What if we stepped out in oceans deep
What if we don’t see yet still believe 

What if we choose to turn from all our sins
Won’t God He turn to us forgive

Title: WHAT KIND OF LOVE IS THIS

What kind of love is this
That climbs the hill

That takes my place



That gives His life
And clears my name



Oh, I want to know
What kind of love is this



What kind of love is this
That gives His Son



That bears the sin
Of everyone



What kind of love is this
That cries alone



That tastes of death
To bring me home



Oh, I want to know
What kind of love this is



It's wonderful
It's glorious



It's full of grace
And full of mercy



Powerful
It's marvellous



That's what this love is
That's what God's love is



What kind of love is this
That fills my soul



That lifts me up
And makes me whole



What kind of love is this
That gives me hope



That dries my tears
And brings me joy



Oh, I want to know
What kind of love this is



Jesus, Jesus
He's full of grace
And full of mercy



Jesus, my Jesus
This is what love is
That's what God's love is



Title: WHAT THE LORD HAS DONE IN ME

Let the weak say I am strong
Let the poor say I am rich



Let the blind say I can see
It's what the Lord has done in me



Hosanna, hosanna
To the Lamb that was slain



Hosanna, hosanna
Jesus died and rose again



Into the river I will wade
There my sins are washed away



From the heavens mercy streams
Of the Saviour's love for me



I will rise from waters deep
Into the saving arms of God



I will sing salvation songs
Jesus Christ has set me free



Title: WHAT THE WORLD WILL NEVER TAKE

With all I'm holding inside
With all my hope and desires
And all the dreams that I've dreamt



With all I'm hoping to be
And all that the world will bring



And all that fails to compare
You say You want all of me
I wouldn't have it any other way



I have got a Saviour
And He's living in me
Chorus 1
Whoa, I wanna know
I wanna know You today



You're the best thing
That has happened to me



And the world will never take
The world will never take you away



No one could ever take You away




Title: WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR ME

In the darkest night
You called my name
Beckoned me to come



Let me hear Your voice day by day
You're the Holy One
Prechorus 1
I will sing of Your freedom
I will tell of all
The wonderous things You've done



You let me run in Your presence
Let me dance
Gonna get a little crazy for You



I can't stop thinkin' about You, Lord
I can't stop thinkin' about Your love



I can't stop thinkin' about
What You've done for me



Na na n-n-na na na na (x3)
Na na na na na
What You've done for me



Title: WHEN GOD RAN

Almighty God
The Great I AM



Immovable rock
Omnipotent, powerful



Awesome Lord
Victorious warrior



Commanding King of kings
Mighty conqueror
Prechorus 1
And the only time
The only time
I ever saw Him run



Was when He ran to me
He took me in His arms



Held my head to His chest
Said, "My son's come home again"



Lifted my face
Wiped the tears off my eyes
With forgiveness in His voice



He said,
"Son, do you know I still love you?"



He caught me by surprise
When God ran



The day I left home
I knew I'd broken His heart



I wondered then if things
Would ever be the same



Then one night
I remembered His love for me



And down that dusty road
Ahead I could see



It was the only time
Was the only time
I ever saw Him run



And then He ran to me
He took me in His arms



Held my head to His chest
Said, "My son's come home again"



Lifted my face
Wiped the tears off my eyes



With forgiveness in His voice
He said, "Son, do you know I still love you?"



He caught me by surprise
And He brought me to my knees
When God ran



I saw Him run to me



I was so ashamed
All alone and so far away



But now I know He's been waiting for this day



I saw Him ran to me
He took me in His arms



Held my head to His chest
Said, "My son's come home again"



Lifted my face
Wiped the tears off my eyes



With forgiveness in His voice
I felt His love for me again



He ran to me
He took me in His arms



Held my head to His chest
Said, "My son's come home again"



Lifted my face
Wiped the tears off my eyes



With forgiveness in His voice
He said, "Son"



He called me son
He said, "Son, do you know I still love You?"



He ran to me
I saw Him run to me



I ran to Him
When God ran



And I ran to Him
When God ran

What a happy day will be
When the King returns again



To catch away His long awaited bride
We shall all ascend on high



To our homes beyond the sky
Never more to roam here on earth



What a glorious day will be
When His blessed face I see



The One who came to die to set us free
We shall walk the streets of gold
And rejoice forever more



In the presence of the
Lamb of Calvary



We shall meet the gospel writers
And the patriots of old



Who by faith did walk this glorious path of life
What a union that will be



When each other's face we see
In that heavenly mansion we've received from Him



If you've never placed your life
In the hands of Christ the King



Then you'll never know this hope we have within
He who died on Calvary



Paid the price to set you free
And will freely give to you this hope today

好像没有人与我同在

我现在真是 不明白
怎么自己感到（这样）无奈

我需要有人来指引我
请你告诉我该怎么办！

我只想多赚一点钱
快快乐乐过我每一天

可当我有了这一切
心中感到还是有缺陷

把青春都给了事业
赚钱谈情迷糊过每天

停下脚步来回头看
难道人生只有（这样）子吗

这真是 哎哟啊 我怎么办

尽了我全力还是一样
这真是哎哟啊 有谁明白

好像没有人与我同在
我现在真是 不明白

怎么自己感到（这样）无奈
我需要有人来指引我

请你告诉我该怎么办！
当你想到 你的梦想

There is no more for heaven now to give

For by my side, the Saviour He will stay

For in my need, His power is displayed 

To this I hold, my Shepherd will defend me 
Through the deepest valley He will lead

Oh the night has been won, and I shall overcome
Yet not I, but through Christ in me 

No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven
The future sure, the price it has been paid

For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
And He was raised to overthrow the grave

To this I hold, my sin has been defeated
Jesus now and ever is my plea

Oh the chains are released
I can sing I am free

Yet not I, but through Christ in me

With every breath I long to follow Jesus
For He has said that He will bring me home

And day by day I know He will renew me
Until I stand with joy before the throne

To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
All the glory evermore to Him

When the race is complete
Still my lips shall repeat 

Yet not I, but through Christ in me

My heart belongs to You
Jesus

But I'm so glad that You do
You've changed my heart
Prechorus 1
And You set me free
Now I'm trusting
Now I'm living for You



CHORUS:
I've got hope for the day
Because Your mercies are new
And if I lose my way
Your love will lead me
I'll always come home to You

No earthly treasure
Not money or pleasure
Can satisfy me like You do




Title: You Are The One (Who Brings The Rain)

I can't seem to understand
The reason why I'm hurting
Was this part of Your plan
And is it going to end



I've been running for so long
And the sky is getting darker
Looking for a place
Where I can stand until it ends



The grass is greener on the other side
Where I don't belong
Sometimes it's lonely but I'll stand until
I see Your face again



CHORUS:
You are the One who brings the rain
The force to wash away my pain
And in that darkness I can see
A light of hope alive in me



And I believe You when You say
Your eye is on the sparrow
I know You're watching me
I know You've set me free



From all the fear
That used to hold me down
A better way I've found
It's time to heal and time to grow
Into the child You used to know



And I don't know where we're going
But I don't care about that
Because I feel Your hand in mine

When I consider the work of Your fingers
The sun and the stars, the land and the sea

Just why You would ever take thought of me

You are acquainted with all of my ways
Bought by Your blood, drawn by Your love
I am Your dwelling place

Showing me favor again and again
I’m set apart, dear to Your heart
You called me by name

Give You my life

To give us life abundantly

In Your command

When I'm just so unworthy of You



You are just too good
That I want to sing praises to You
To my one and only God in my heart
Who cares for me
Who loves me so much



Lord, I just can't wait to say I love You
I love You



You stretch out Your hand , let me fall in
To a love that is so great that I can't just describe



I just can't write
I just can't read
Without You to teach me the Words
To write of all Your love




Title: Your Love For Me

My eyes can see Your hand
At every passing glance
Your glory covers
All the earth and sky



Your goodness fills my life
In every circumstance
My heart is opened wide
My hands are lifted high



CHORUS:
You are my God
And I am Your servant
I am in awe of Your love for me



Your mercy flows though
I don't deserve it
I want to shout it out
I'm in awe of Your love for me



I've found a deeper faith
Within Your love's embrace
Where all I want is
What You have for me



I'm drinking from the cup
Of pure and endless grace
My heart is opened wide
My hands are lifted high



Title: Your Love Is Better Than Life

Your love is better than life (echo)
All I really need is You (echo)
In a dry and thirsty land (echo)
My soul is longing for You (echo)



Lord, You're the Bread of life
Only You can satisfy (echo)
Come, fill this heart of mine (echo)
With Your sweet love divine (echo)



We're singing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, praise God
And we're singing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Amen




Title: Your Love Is Deep

Your love is long
Your love is wide

My view of grace
Higher than this worldly place
Longer than this road I travel
Wider than this gap you filled

Title: 幽谷亮光

黑夜中飞翔  盘旋着迷惘
雁过无痕空荡  只你懂我孤鸣着悲凉

走不出围墙  踯躅在过往
空谷足音回响  唯你知我夜色正苍茫

寻找着彼岸  浓雾中彷徨
不期然的相伴  温暖了行囊中的梦想

心起伏山峦  深谷几幽暗
你伸出的杖杆  断开了往日缠裹牵绊

幽谷亮光  是门紧闭后的天窗
幽谷亮光  是柳暗花明的春江

幽谷亮光  是路到尽头的转弯
幽谷亮光  是你牵我的手不放

山穷水复地方 总有出走方向
抬起头挺胸膛 远望天空晴朗

Title: 开你心门 (福建)

安慰伤悲擦你目屎
请主耶稣进你心内

Title: 愛是不保留 (ENGLISH)

常听说世界爱没长久  
 哪里会有爱无尽头
 I've always been told love won't survive  
 Promises will turn into lies   
 




尘俗的爱只在乎曾拥有  
 一刻灿烂便要走 
 The world just thinks   
 Love comes and passes through  
 It never lasts pure and true   
 




而我却确信爱是恒久
 碰到了你已无别求 
 But I still believe love can last  
 It's Your unfailing love   
 That gives me rest   




无从解释、不可说明的爱  
 千秋过後仍长存不朽  
 You were there   
 When I needed You most  
 I'll never walk all alone   




谁人受痛苦被牵挂在木头  
 至高的爱尽见于刺穿的手  
 On the cross You died   
 And took away my sin  
 Love so wondrous   
 No one ever could deserve  
 




看, 血在流反映爱没保留   
 持续不死的爱到万世不休   
 Your bleeding hands   
 Proved Your love unreserved
 You're my greatest joy   
 And treasure on the earth 



唯求奉上生命全归主所有 
 要将一切献尽于我主的手
 Make my life   
 A fragrant offering I pray  
 Help me Lord   
 To serve You truly every day

Title: 诗篇 23

耶和华是我的牧者 
 我必不致缺乏
 他使我躺卧在青草地上
 领我在可安歇的水边
 （重复）



他使我灵魂苏醒
 为自己的名 引导我走义路
 我虽然行过死荫的幽谷
 也不怕遭害



因为你与我同在
 你的杖和竿都安慰我




 在我敌人的面前
 你为我摆设宴席
 祢用油膏了我的头 
 使我福杯满溢



我一生一世必有恩惠慈爱
 随着我，随着我
 我且要住在耶和华的殿中
 直到永远 



耶和华是我的牧者
 我必不致缺乏



Title: 诗篇 133

看哪弟兄和睦同居

又好比黑门的甘露
降在锡安山



因为在那里有耶和华
所命定的福 就是永远的生命


Title: 诗篇130篇 1-4节 

 耶和华，我从深处,    
 从深处向你求告 
 求你听我的声音,  愿你侧耳 



侧耳听我恳求，听我恳求的声音 
 你若究察罪孽，谁能站住



但在你有赦免之恩
 要叫人敬畏你 
 我等候耶和华 
 我心等候     我也仰望 



但在你有赦免之恩

Title: 这是我的王

 把双眼闭上,我打开心窗

 代罪的羔羊,在十字架上
 这是我的王,  牺牲的王



我的王,哦我的王
 主耶稣是我的王
 我的王,哦我的王, 主耶稣
 



 三天后的早上,他战胜死亡
 死里复活的王,有谁能够抵挡
 解开罪恶的捆绑,带给世人盼望
 这是我的王,复活的王    



 我要定睛仰望,要不停的颂赞
 把赞美都献上,敬拜永不中断
 曾被杀的羔羊,今坐在宝座上
 这是我的王,荣耀的王

 又有谁的恩典能与他相比




 因他舍命给我
 因他使我眼睛可看见




双手被钉在十架
 只有这双手能医治我的痛




 你是否已认识他
 你是否握着他钉痕的手




 让他做你的朋友
 请你握他钉痕的手

Title: 风很大

风很大    天色变暗
心肝头感觉很喘


路也长    脚手又酸
天上黑云遮到光


看不到天上的光
求主来作我的光


开我心里的眼睛
看到主牵我的手


主的声叫我别怕
因为有他来作 伴


叫我记得他的话
他的话是光 他的灵来充满


我相信耶 稣的话
 顾我，疼我，帮助我


主的话教我怎样走
主的灵每日充满我
